# Hell: The Nine Layers
Hell, home of demons, darkness, and the Devil, is divided into nine distinct layers:

## Layer 1 – The Human Layer
This is where human souls are confined, endlessly tortured. Because human souls are the most valuable, demons crave them above all else. Separating humans from demons and other creatures ensures their torment can be sustained for eternity.

## Layer 2 – The Arena
A brutal place where humans and weak creatures are forced to fight to the death. Those who endure the horrors of this layer face different fates.

Creatures: Either destroyed or sent onward to Layer 3.

Humans: Either destroyed, sent to Layer 3 or 4, or forced into servitude, tasked with torturing the souls trapped in Layer 1.

## Layer 3 – The Domain of Creatures
The largest of all layers, it connects to every Hell across the multiverse. Though no demon has ever reached another universe by traversing it, a few have crossed into realms ruled by other Devils. This layer is home to most demons, the Devil’s castles, and Hell’s heart itself. At its center lies a heavily guarded portal—watched by a Demon God—that allows travel between all layers and beyond.

## Layer 4 – The Smallest Layer
Though the smallest, it is rich in resources. A peaceful land of rivers and nature, it is where water and nature demons are born before being sent to Layer 3. Ruled by seven Demon Kings, this layer also holds a secret portal to Heaven. Humans sent here serve the Demon Kings.

## Layer 5 – The Cursed Arsenal
Known as Asmodeus’s Trash Heap, this is where the Devil discards unused weapons. Many Veylorin weapons also end up here. Over time, they absorb demonic blood and dark magic, becoming cursed. When about five hundred of them awaken, demonic spiders collect and scatter them across Layer 3, sparking chaos as demons battle to claim them. This event usually occurs every 500,000 years—unless Asmodeus intervenes.

## Layer 6 – The Prison
This entire layer serves as the eternal prison of the Flesh Demon King.

## Layer 7 – The Threshold of Death
The gateway into the Death Realms. Few return once they pass through.

## Layer 8 – The Abyss Realm
A domain of endless void and shadow, where even demons fear to linger.

## Layer 9 – The Chaos Seal
The final layer, where the Chaos God is bound in eternal imprisonment.
