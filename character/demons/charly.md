# Charly

**Age:** unkown 
**Size:** 2.4 meter   
**Magic:** holy, liquid, roses, dark, and glass   
**Source of Magic:** souls 
Charly’s strength comes from the countless souls he consumes. He was the first demon to discover how to cultivate souls, creating vast soul farms that ensured he would never run out of power, As long as he possesses these souls, Charly cannot die. Each one fuels his body, repairs his wounds, and fortifies his essence against destruction. To strike him down means little unless his soul reserves are emptied—an impossible task for most, given the infinite nature of his farms.
