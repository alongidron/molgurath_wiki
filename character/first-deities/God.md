"Smite" is a magical energy that possesses the ability to eliminate living beings, akin to Death for All, but with some limitations and differences. While Death for All can extinguish any form of life, including inanimate objects, Smite specifically targets living beings. However, it does have the additional capability to destroy minerals, though it is not as potent in this aspect as Death for All.

One notable characteristic of Smite is its visibility. Unlike Death for All, Smite is apparent and observable, allowing potential targets to perceive and possibly evade the attack if they are quick and agile enough.

Despite this potential to dodge, no one has successfully managed to do so yet. This suggests that Smite is exceptionally fast or possesses other properties that make it extremely difficult to evade, even for those with quick reflexes.

#### -Source of Magic: faith 

For as long as religion and cults exist, God will gain power from every creature that participates in them. Fortunately for God, he can draw magical power from all human worlds. However, religion and cults can be destroyed, which poses a unique vulnerability for God. Unlike the other Supreme Deitie that leaves on molgurath, God is the only one whose magic source can potentially come to an end, making him the weakest among the Supreme Deitie that leaves on molgurath.

God, Supreme Deitie that leaves on molgurath, took on the monumental task of constructing Heaven, a realm that would embody purity, serenity, and divine light. With boundless creativity and unwavering determination, God began shaping the fabric of this celestial realm.

#### -Mini story: 
With time, molgurath was filled with creatures made by Life, and they worshiped God because they wanted to enter Heaven. God saw and loved their worship so much that he created Hell to scare the creatures. As God continued to weave the intricate tapestry of Heaven, word of this divine realm spread like wildfire across molgurath. Creatures from all corners of the land, drawn by the promise of eternal peace and salvation, flocked to worship at the feet of their creator.

At first, everything seemed fine, but soon Life began to notice that his creatures were only embracing the light, and every creature that dared to think otherwise was being killed. This angered Life, and he asked God to stop and stay out of his territory, but God didn’t listen. Over time, God's influence grew stronger, overtaking Life's domain. Despite Life's warnings, God continued to expand his influence over the creatures of molgurath, drawing them deeper into his heavenly realm. As more creatures flocked to worship God, Life became increasingly concerned, watching as his creations abandoned their true nature for the light of Heaven.

With no way of fighting back, Life turned to Death for help. Death agreed to assist Life with his problem, and together, they started planning how to take down God. Their first move was to empower Lucifer, granting him powers that helped make Hell a real place. As Hell grew in size and strength, God began to fear that Hell might rise against him, so he decided to exterminate it. The battle was fierce, and in the end, God managed to destroy Hell, but he was left exhausted. Life and Death used this opportunity to seal him away forever.

With Heaven secure and his influence unchallenged, God turned his attention to further expanding his dominion. Yet, as the light of Heaven shone brighter, casting shadows upon the world below, Life grew increasingly troubled. His creatures, once diverse and vibrant, now marched blindly toward the celestial realm, leaving behind the essence of what they once were. Desperation gnawed at Life’s core as he watched the erosion of his creations' autonomy.

In his distress, Life sought counsel from Death, the one being who understood existence as intimately as he did. Together, they devised a plan to counter God's influence and restore balance to molgurath. Their first step was to empower Lucifer, a fallen angel who had been cast out of Heaven for his defiance. With newfound strength from Life and Death, Lucifer transformed Hell into a formidable realm, the mirror opposite of Heaven. The flames of rebellion flickered in Hell, drawing in the disenchanted and the defiant.

God, sensing the growing threat of Hell, launched a relentless campaign to eradicate it from existence. The clash between Heaven and Hell shook the very foundations of molgurath, unleashing cataclysmic waves of destruction that tore through the fabric of reality itself. Although Hell fell before the might of God's wrath, the battle took a heavy toll. Exhausted from the fight, God became vulnerable, his divine power drained. Seeing their chance, Life and Death combined their forces to seal God away for eternity.
