The existence of a special god power possessed by Life, one of the earliest deities, remains uncertain due to the lack of observable usage. However, considering Life's status as one of the original deities, it is plausible to assume that he possesses some unique divine ability.

The ambiguity surrounding Life's potential god power could stem from various factors. It's possible that Life's abilities are subtle or intrinsic to his nature, making them less apparent compared to the overt powers wielded by other deities. Alternatively, Life might choose not to utilize a specific god power, preferring to operate through the natural processes of creation, growth, and renewal.

Despite the absence of explicit demonstrations of a special god power, the significance of Life as one of the foundational deities suggests that he likely possesses some form of unique ability or influence that contributes to the balance and order of the cosmos.

#### Source of Magic: leaving creature

Life gains his magic power from every single living creature. However, even though every god made their own creatures, as time passed, there were more dead creatures than living, which is why Life became the third strongest of the four original deities.

Life, one of the first deities to exist on Monstrum, took on the monumental task of giving life to the barren world. With a gentle touch and a whisper of ancient incantations, Life breathed vitality into the desolate land. From the fertile soil sprouted verdant forests teeming with exotic flora, their vibrant colors painting the landscape like an artist's palette.

As Life's power coursed through Monstrum, it stirred something deep within the earth. From the depths of the planet's core emerged the first creatures, their forms grotesque yet captivating. Some had scales shimmering like precious gems, while others bore wings that glimmered with iridescent hues under the newly formed sun. Life watched with satisfaction as these beings roamed the land, each one a testament to its divine craftsmanship.

Things looked good for Life, but it didn’t last long. The other gods began creating cults that took away the freedom Life had been giving to the creatures. Over time, the creatures started seeing Life as a threat to their gods, and they attempted to eliminate him. Life spent a long time teleporting and running away, as he had no way to defend himself. Eventually, when cornered, Life improvised and discovered he could "overheal" the creatures. This over-healing removed all their negative emotions, but without negativity, the creatures became dumb and incapable of further evolution.

Life, now on the run from both the cults of the gods and the creatures he had once nurtured, found himself in a precarious position. Fleeing through the dense forests he had helped flourish, Life realized he needed a solution to the chaos engulfing Monstrum. Seeking help, he turned to Death, who agreed to assist him. After some time, Life and Death worked together to seal God.

With God sealed, Life and Death faced the daunting task of restoring balance to Monstrum. Although God's influence had waned, chaos still threatened to consume the world. Life knew they would also need the help of Time. However, approaching Time was no easy feat. Time had never shown interest in the creatures Life created, but without his help, it would be harder for Life and Death to fully restore order.

Life and Death pleaded their case to Time, explaining the turmoil that had befallen Monstrum in God's absence. They implored Time to lend his power to restore the balance that had once flourished under Life’s gentle touch.

Under the guidance of these three deities, along with the newly emerged gods, the creatures of Monstrum flourished once more. Freed from the oppressive cults of the past, they embraced their newfound freedom and evolved in ways that honored the delicate balance of life and death.

After a long period of peace, the new gods who had replaced God—Nephilis, Lunaris, and Thalassiax—sought revenge on Life and Death for their actions. They tricked Life and Death into protecting the seal they had placed on God. However, before Life left, he created a clone of himself to take his place.
