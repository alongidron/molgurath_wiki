The dragon of the end or the time ender is a cosmic creature that destroys everything in his path no one but the librarian managed to see and lived to describe him, however, the librarian used clones and teleported them very far into space to track backward the destruction of the dragon and all he saw was a Gary dragon with red eyes, and all the librarian could learn is that once that dragon will find his way to molgurath then they will all die.
The question remains if the dragon ever finds molgurath will it be able to fight back or is it doomed like the rest of the planets?
