The Tarasks were created by molgurath with a specific purpose: to eliminate any individuals who wielded reality-altering magic, a power perceived as a threat to the stability of the cosmos. These formidable creatures were engineered to be immune to all forms of magic, rendering conventional mystical defenses useless against them. Once activated, the Tarasks would relentlessly pursue their designated targets, exhibiting an unyielding determination to fulfill their mission. After fulfilling their grim purpose, the Tarasks meet their end, vanishing without a trace. This deliberate act of disappearance ensures that no remnants or evidence of their existence remain, leaving behind only whispers and legends as a cautionary tale to those who would dare tamper with the laws of reality. 
In their dormant state, the Tarasks reside deep within the core of the planet, where they lay in a state of slumber, awaiting the activation of their directive. This dormant period serves as a safeguard against unnecessary aggression, ensuring that the Tarasks only awaken in response to a significant disruption to the fabric of reality.
