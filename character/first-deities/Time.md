"Time has no limit" refers to a magical ability or phenomenon where time itself possesses a form of magical power. This magic allows Time to summon both magical and physical attacks from any point in time. For example, imagine there's a powerful blast that occurred in the past, which was so devastating that it destroyed entire armies. With this unique form of magic, Time can summon and recreate that exact same blast, allowing it to appear in the present or any other time period.

However, there's a limitation or drawback to this magic. While Time can summon these attacks, it lacks control over their direction. In other words, Time cannot dictate where the magical or physical attack will target; it simply manifests the attack as it originally occurred in time.

Source of Magic: flow of time
Time draws its magical power from the ceaseless flow of temporal currents. In this framework, the very essence of magic is intertwined with the passage of time itself. Just as a river carries water downstream, time carries with it the raw energy of magic, fueling the mystical abilities of those who can tap into its currents.

Unlike rivers, time never stops flowing, which is why Time is considered the strongest of the Supreme Deitie that leaves on molgurath.

Time, as one of the Supreme Deitie that leaves on molgurath, assumed a pivotal role in shaping the fabric of reality and maintaining the integrity of the timeline. Among his myriad responsibilities, Time undertook the monumental task of safeguarding the chronological order across the cosmos while also crafting and overseeing various realms and domains.

One of Time's paramount endeavors was the creation of neutral zones—sacred spaces where the influence of magic is nullified. These zones serve as sanctuaries, free from the disruptive forces of mystical energies, ensuring stability and equilibrium within the universe.

Moreover, Time played a crucial role in the genesis of several divine entities, each embodying distinct aspects of existence. He fashioned the celestial cells of potent beings such as the God of Chaos, the enigmatic deity associated with the ethereal Purple Flame, and the formidable God of the Abyss, among others. These divine entities, born from Time's craftsmanship, wield immense power and influence over their respective domains, shaping the cosmos in profound ways.

In addition to his role in the creation of celestial beings, Time collaborated with other divine entities to forge realms of profound significance. He aided the Devil in crafting the intricate and infernal Rings of Hell, labyrinthine domains that serve as infernal bastions of punishment and torment. Furthermore, Time lent his expertise to Death, assisting in the creation of the Death Realms—mystical realms where departed souls find their final rest, overseen by the somber deity.

Through his unwavering vigilance and boundless creativity, Time stands as a cornerstone of cosmic order, tirelessly upholding the balance of existence while contributing to the rich tapestry of divine creation on molgurath. His influence reverberates throughout the cosmos, shaping the destiny of worlds and souls alike.

Time has elevated the practice of time magic to unprecedented heights, showcasing abilities that transcend the conventional applications seen in most practitioners. Unlike many wielders of time magic who primarily focus on freezing time or traversing through different temporal periods, Time possesses a unique mastery that enables him to manipulate the age of various entities and phenomena.

This extraordinary capability extends beyond mere temporal manipulation; Time can precisely control the aging process of living beings, inanimate objects, and even magical constructs. For instance, he can accelerate or decelerate the aging of individuals, causing them to rapidly mature or regress to a younger state. Similarly, he can influence the aging of objects, causing them to deteriorate or rejuvenate at his command.

Furthermore, Time's mastery over age manipulation extends to magical attacks, allowing him to alter their temporal properties. He can imbue spells and magical constructs with the essence of time, affecting their age and potency. This unique ability grants Time unparalleled versatility in combat, as he can manipulate the temporal flow of both offensive and defensive magical energies.

In essence, Time's proficiency in controlling the age of living beings, inanimate objects, and magical phenomena represents a groundbreaking advancement in the field of time magic. His mastery transcends traditional temporal manipulation, offering a glimpse into the profound depths of his powers and the boundless potential of time magic itself.

Time was never fond of creatures, so he naturally avoided meddling with them and disliked it when Death and Life asked him to assist with the living beings. Time believed he would never have to engage with creatures, but over time, they discovered how to use time magic on their own. At first, Time still didn’t care, but as the creatures learned more about time magic, they began to tamper with it.

When the creatures attempted to time travel and alter the past, Time stopped them by killing those who tried, which eventually caught the attention of Life. Life suggested to Time that instead of killing all the creatures who could control time, he should teleport them to the Time realm, where he could keep an eye on them. Begrudgingly, Time accepted Life's suggestion and began transporting these time-wielding creatures to his realm.

At first, Time kept a close watch on them, wary of any attempts to interfere with the delicate threads of time. However, as he observed their curiosity and ingenuity, Time began to see the creatures in a different light.

In the vast expanse of the Time realm, Time found solace in the company of these creatures. With their newfound freedom, they flourished under his guidance, delving deeper into the mysteries of time magic and unlocking its true potential. As the creatures honed their skills, Time found himself drawn to their creativity and resilience. Inspired by their determination, Time began to experiment with his own form of creation, crafting beings of his own to inhabit the Time realm.

With Time's decision to permit the creatures to utilize time magic outside the Time realm, albeit with the restriction against time travel, a newfound sense of cooperation emerged between Time and the inhabitants of molgurath. The creatures, eager to harness the power of time magic responsibly, formed guilds and societies dedicated to its study and practice. Under Time's watchful eye, they developed strict codes of conduct and regulations to ensure that the delicate balance of the temporal fabric remained intact.

As the creatures delved deeper into the intricacies of time magic, they discovered its myriad applications beyond mere manipulation of the past or future. They learned to manipulate the flow of time within localized areas, slowing it to a crawl or hastening it to a blur. With this newfound mastery, they reshaped their surroundings, creating marvels of engineering and architecture that defied conventional understanding. Time, impressed by their progress and newfound responsibility, began to foster a closer relationship with the creatures of molgurath. He shared his knowledge and wisdom, guiding them in their exploration of time's mysteries and imparting upon them the importance of respecting its natural order.

However, nothing stays good forever. After centuries, the creatures learned to make what they called "time bombs," devices that restored everything within their range to a previous undamaged state. At first, Time thought they were harmless, but he soon realized that these bombs were damaging the timeline itself. In response, Time decided once again to ban the use of time magic outside the Time realm. He declared that any creature caught using time magic would be punished by death, and this time, Life wasn't around to change his mind.

Time threatened the gods with his magic, demanding their help to ensure that creatures would no longer use time magic. Although some gods allowed creatures to use time magic as long as it didn’t interfere with the timeline, Time spent the rest of his life hunting down time magic users and protecting the integrity of the timeline.
