Charlan Kirreth was a devoted believer in God, a man whose heart sought peace for both humans and creatures alike. His compassion was not bound by race or kin, and he dedicated his life to healing rifts, feeding the hungry, and defending the weak. For his unshakable faith and countless good deeds, God blessed him with holy power—light that could shield, heal, and purify. Even after God vanished from the world, Charlan’s blessings did not fade.

#### Mini story: 
Charlan Kirreth was one of the greatest humans ever to walk the world, a man whose faith and unshakable heart allowed him to live for more than thirty-one thousand years. Unlike others who pursued power through forbidden means or bargains with gods and demons, Charlan’s strength was born of belief. His devotion to the divine and his tireless service to all creatures—human and beast alike—made him a living miracle, blessed with endurance far beyond mortal limits.

He was not a king nor a conqueror, yet his presence united nations. Wherever Charlan walked, disputes ended, and battles ceased. With a shield upon his arm and a sword in hand, he became both guardian and guide. He carried no crown, but people called him their protector, their shepherd, and their hope. His sword shone with the light of his faith, while his shield bore the scars of countless wars—proof of how many lives he had saved by standing between the innocent and the cruel.

Even demons, who rarely respected humanity, spoke his name with caution and regard. They despised his unwavering opposition to evil, yet could not deny the honor in his heart and the purity of his cause. In every clash with darkness, Charlan chose sacrifice over selfishness. He did not strike for glory, but for the safety of those who had no strength to defend themselves.

Across the centuries, Charlan became a legend. He defended villages from marauding beasts, stood against rogue gods who sought dominion, and calmed storms that threatened to erase entire cities. When chaos spread, his words restored order. When despair grew heavy, his presence rekindled hope. And through it all, his faith never faltered.

But even legends must face their end. Charlan’s final battle came against the Demon King, a tyrant whose power threatened to drown the world in shadow. Their war shook the earth and scarred the heavens. The Demon King, unable to best Charlan through strength alone, turned to cowardice—tricks, ambushes, and poisoned schemes. Blow after blow, the hero endured, until betrayal finally brought him low.

Yet even as death closed in, Charlan’s light did not fade. With the last of his strength, he lifted his sword one final time and banished the Demon King back to the depths of hell. His body fell, but his spirit remained triumphant. The world mourned the man who had carried humanity on his shoulders for thirty-one thousand years, yet his sacrifice became eternal proof of faith’s power—that belief, compassion, and courage could overcome even the darkest of evils.

To this day, Charlan Kirreth’s name is spoken not only among humans but whispered by demons and sung by creatures of the wild. His legend lives on as a reminder that mortals, through faith and devotion, can rise to stand among gods.
