molgurath has six moons: red, blue, purple, dark, white, and gray. 
The red moon appears once every 1,000,000 years for a month, causing chaos and distraction when it appears in the sky. It also increases the power of blood and fire magic users.

The blue moon appears once every 10,000 years for a week or when it has been summoned, the blue moon raises the water levels and increases the power of water, ice, and  lightning magic users 

The purple moon appears once every 500,000 years for two weeks or when Zila is doing her reticule for a day.
The purple moon wakes up the dead and increases their strength and resistance also purple magic users can benefit from the strength of the moon

The dark moon appears once every 10,000,000 years
It makes all the creatures lose malice for a day and makes all the nonmagic users savage killers 
The white moon appears after the black moon to help recover the damage that the dark moon has caused 

The gray moon is a regular moon that has no special effects and always appears at night. 
molgurath is about 69,911 km 
And the biggest planet in the system.

Unknown to many of its inhabitants, molgurath is not merely a planet but a sentient, living entity. While it does not communicate directly with the creatures that dwell upon it, molgurath possesses mystical powers of profound depth and range. Among these is the ability to trap Yeng and Yen, two colossal and formidable dragons, which serve as its guardians against the menacing Dragon of the End.

molgurath also imparts a unique trait to its residents—the potential for mortality. Creatures that linger too long on its surface are imbued with the possibility of death, a stark deviation from their immortal origins in other realms. This peculiar rule, uncovered through diligent research by the Librarian, is believed to stem from molgurath's disdain for the notion of immortality, which it regards as a frivolous trick. Nevertheless, there are exceptions. Entities such as Life, Death, Time, God, and the Tarasks remain eternally invulnerable, immune to molgurath's otherwise universal decree, provided they abstain from direct conflicts or alliances.
Furthermore, molgurath holds the alarming ability to create or erase beings from existence, a power it exercises with judicious restraint, making its full extent largely unknown to its denizens. Only a select few—the Four First Gods, the dragons Yeng and Yen, the Librarian, and the Guardian—are privy to the true nature and capabilities of molgurath.

Given the vast expanse of molgurath, this guide will focus on the region known as Grymmwald. This area is particularly fascinating due to its diverse landscapes, which include deserts, forests, snowfields, mountains, and open plains, as well as more exotic locales like volcanoes, perilous and benign swamps, and zones that seem touched by demonic and angelic presences, and more. Grymmwald offers a unique tapestry of environments, each contributing to its mystique and allure, making it a region ripe for exploration and adventure.

The reason Grymmwald boasts such diverse areas is largely due to the magic waves permeating the air there—it acts almost like a magnet for magic. This concentration of magical forces is what shapes the region's varied landscapes and climates. Consequently, Grymmwald is renowned for harboring some of the most powerful creatures in molgurath. These beings are often unique to their environments, influenced and empowered by the rich magical currents that define this region. The magic not only affects the flora and fauna but also the very nature of the geographical features, creating a dynamically evolving realm where adventure and mystery abound.

In the heart of Grymmwald lies a region with a tumultuous past, once ruled by the god of chaos. After his fall, this area underwent significant transformations, becoming the largest natural zone in molgurath and covering about 50 square miles. Central to this zone is a powerful artifact left behind by the god of chaos, a relic of immense power and mystery.
