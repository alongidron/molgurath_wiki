molgurath has six moons: red, blue, purple, dark, white, and gray. 
The red moon appears once every 1,000,000 years for a month, causing chaos and distraction when it appears in the sky. It also increases the power of blood and fire magic users.

The blue moon appears once every 10,000 years for a week or when it has been summoned, the blue moon raises the water levels and increases the power of water, ice, and  lightning magic users 

The purple moon appears once every 500,000 years for two weeks or when Zila is doing her reticule for a day.
The purple moon wakes up the dead and increases their strength and resistance also purple magic users can benefit from the strength of the moon

The dark moon appears once every 10,000,000 years
It makes all the creatures lose malice for a day and makes all the nonmagic users savage killers 
The white moon appears after the black moon to help recover the damage that the dark moon has caused 

The gray moon is a regular moon that has no special effects and always appears at night. 
molgurath is about 69,911 km 
And the biggest planet in the system.

Unknown to many of its inhabitants, molgurath is not merely a planet but a sentient, living entity. While it does not communicate directly with the creatures that dwell upon it, molgurath possesses mystical powers of profound depth and range. Among these is the ability to trap Yeng and Yen, two colossal and formidable dragons, which serve as its guardians against the menacing Dragon of the End.

molgurath also imparts a unique trait to its residents—the potential for mortality. Creatures that linger too long on its surface are imbued with the possibility of death, a stark deviation from their immortal origins in other realms. This peculiar rule, uncovered through diligent research by the Librarian, is believed to stem from molgurath's disdain for the notion of immortality, which it regards as a frivolous trick. Nevertheless, there are exceptions. Entities such as Life, Death, Time, God, and the Tarasks remain eternally invulnerable, immune to molgurath's otherwise universal decree, provided they abstain from direct conflicts or alliances.
Furthermore, molgurath holds the alarming ability to create or erase beings from existence, a power it exercises with judicious restraint, making its full extent largely unknown to its denizens. Only a select few—the Four First Gods, the dragons Yeng and Yen, the Librarian, and the Guardian—are privy to the true nature and capabilities of molgurath.

Given the vast expanse of molgurath, this guide will focus on the region known as Grymmwald. This area is particularly fascinating due to its diverse landscapes, which include deserts, forests, snowfields, mountains, and open plains, as well as more exotic locales like volcanoes, perilous and benign swamps, and zones that seem touched by demonic and angelic presences, and more. Grymmwald offers a unique tapestry of environments, each contributing to its mystique and allure, making it a region ripe for exploration and adventure.

The reason Grymmwald boasts such diverse areas is largely due to the magic waves permeating the air there—it acts almost like a magnet for magic. This concentration of magical forces is what shapes the region's varied landscapes and climates. Consequently, Grymmwald is renowned for harboring some of the most powerful creatures in molgurath. These beings are often unique to their environments, influenced and empowered by the rich magical currents that define this region. The magic not only affects the flora and fauna but also the very nature of the geographical features, creating a dynamically evolving realm where adventure and mystery abound.

In the heart of Grymmwald lies a region with a tumultuous past, once ruled by the god of chaos. After his fall, this area underwent significant transformations, becoming the largest natural zone in molgurath and covering about 50 square miles. Central to this zone is a powerful artifact left behind by the god of chaos, a relic of immense power and mystery.

This artifact, known for its ability to manipulate and amplify magical energies, has become a magnet for conflict. It draws the Overworld Lords, powerful beings from across the land, into fierce competition. These lords, each with their own formidable powers and armies, clash violently as they vie for control of the artifact.

As the years passed, the Overworld Lords, initially drawn into relentless battles over the artifact, came to a stark realization. The true challenge in Grymmwald wasn't the skirmishes against each other, but rather surviving the treacherous and magically volatile environment of the natural zone itself.

The Overworld Lords soon discovered a critical limitation upon entering Grymmwald’s natural zone: their own magic was rendered ineffective. This unexpected nullification of magical abilities significantly heightened the challenge of surviving in this hostile environment. It appeared that the same chaotic energies that made the land so rich in magical flora and fauna also created a barrier that neutralized external magical influences.

To further complicate their quest, the zone was inhabited by unique creatures, distinguished by their stark black and white coloration, which aggressively defended their territory against all outsiders. These creatures were adept at surviving and thriving in the magic-suppressed environment of the zone. The Overworld Lords, stripped of their magical powers and facing these formidable native guardians, were forced to rely on their wits, physical prowess, magical technologies, and artifacts. This situation fostered a new level of ingenuity and resourcefulness among them, as they had to adapt to an environment where traditional power dynamics were upended.

Recognizing the insurmountable challenges and dangers within Grymmwald's natural zone, the Overworld Lords made a strategic decision to establish their kingdoms outside its borders. This move marked a significant shift in their approach, from aggressive conquest to cautious coexistence with the zone's volatile nature. The kingdoms were set up around the periphery of the natural zone, each strategically positioned to keep a close watch over the area and the other overlords, yet safely distant to avoid the direct influence of its chaotic energies.

These new realms were tailored to the strengths and needs of their respective rulers, utilizing the varied landscapes that surround the zone—ranging from lush forests and clear rivers to rugged mountains and sweeping plains. In these environments, the Lords leveraged their abilities in areas where magic remained potent and effective, fostering strongholds that reflected their power and prestige. The kingdoms also served as bases for research and exploration into the mysteries of the natural zone, aiming to understand and possibly harness its unique properties without direct confrontation.

Within these strongholds, the Lords fostered cultures and societies that reflected their personal philosophies and the magical energies they could still command. Magic, where it was effective, permeated every aspect of life, enhancing everything from farming to warfare, and from craftsmanship to scholarly pursuits. The kingdoms also became centers of learning and experimentation, as the Lords and their scholars sought to understand the unique properties of the natural zone.

They aimed to devise ways to tap into its power, wondering whether it might be possible to harness the zone's chaotic magic safely or neutralize its dampening effects on their own abilities. These efforts often involved dangerous expeditions into the zone, led by specially trained explorers or magically shielded automatons.

As time progressed, the allure of the artifact within Grymmwald's natural zone began to wane for some of the Overworld Lords. The constant threats from the zone's hostile environment and the challenges associated with harnessing the chaotic magic shifted their priorities. Instead of fixating on the elusive powers of the artifact, these lords started focusing on more tangible and immediate goals—expanding their territories and increasing their influence over more stable and manageable lands.

This shift in focus led to a new dynamic among the kingdoms. Some lords saw expansion as a way to gain resources, secure strategic advantages, and bolster their economies. As they pushed their boundaries outward, tensions naturally escalated with neighboring realms, which were also looking to enhance their own security and prosperity through territorial gains.

As the conflicts among the Overworld Lords escalated, the chaos that ensued became too vast and complex for even the Dark Guardian, traditionally the keeper of balance and order, to manage. This guardian, appointed to mediate conflicts and ensure that no single lord could dominate the others, found their powers insufficient against the tide of ambitions and hostilities that had taken root.

In a stunning and decisive move, the Guardian eliminated Abaddon, the Void's Master, who was considered the strongest and most ambitious of the Overworld Lords. This act sent shockwaves through the realms, illustrating the Guardian's formidable power and willingness to use it to reshape the balance of power. Abaddon's elimination was a clear message that unchecked aggression and dominance would no longer be tolerated.

Following this dramatic intervention, the Guardian transformed the natural zone, a place already fraught with peril and magic, into a sealed dungeon. This dungeon was crafted with five entrances, creating controlled points of access and egress, effectively managing who could enter or leave the zone. Despite the inherent suppression of magic within the zone, which remained in effect, the creation of the dungeon added an additional layer of mystique and challenge, turning it into a place of both danger and opportunity.

Above this newly formed dungeon, the Guardian constructed the Garden of Creativity, a stark contrast to the chaos below. Despite the Guardian's formidable display of power and the transformative actions taken, many of the Overworld Lords continued to focus on their own conflicts, largely disregarding the Guardian’s efforts to foster a more peaceful coexistence. Their interests remained deeply entrenched in rivalries and power struggles, illustrating the depth of their ambitions and the complexities of old enmities.

However, one of the Overworld Lords observed the Guardian's actions and recognized the potential threat to their existence. This Lord, seeing the futility and destructiveness of ongoing conflicts, decided that a change was necessary—not just in personal strategy but in the overall philosophy governing interactions among the lords.

Bell, the Overworld Lord known for his mastery over gravity magic, understood the complex dynamics of power and conflict among his peers. Observing the Guardian’s formidable interventions and the potential threat they posed, Bell recognized that a significant change in strategy was necessary—not merely for personal gain but for the survival and evolution of all the Overworld Lords.

Realizing that subtler diplomatic efforts would likely be ignored in the current climate of aggression and rivalry, Bell decided on a bold move. He initiated invasions into the territories of other Lords. This aggressive tactic was not intended for conquest but rather as a dramatic gesture to gain attention and force engagement from the other Lords. Bell's control over gravity allowed him to execute these invasions with precision and minimal actual harm, showcasing his power and seriousness without causing irreversible damage.

The shock of Bell’s actions achieved its desired effect, compelling the other Overworld Lords to confront the issue head-on. His strategy brought them to the negotiating table, a space where Bell shifted from martial might to diplomatic negotiation. Here, he proposed a Treaty that aimed to unify the Lords under a common cause: the recognition of the Guardian's potential threat to their autonomy and the need for a collective strategy to address this new power dynamic.

The Treaty, as envisioned by Bell, included several key points:

1 Redistribution of Territories:
The treaty required all Overworld Lords to relinquish their territories adjacent to the neutral zone—the area surrounding the dungeon created by the Guardian. By moving away from this zone, each Lord would gain additional territory elsewhere. This strategic retreat was designed to create a buffer zone around the dungeon, preventing easy access for any outsiders and thereby limiting interference.
This redistribution also opened up opportunities for new Overworld Lords in Grymmwald to establish their realms and join the existing political framework, enriching the region with fresh alliances and potential rivalries under controlled conditions.
Lordless creatures and lesser beings within the zone were granted the autonomy to "do their thing," effectively allowing the natural and magical ecosystem of the zone to evolve without lordly interference, potentially leading to new magical developments and creature evolutions.

2 Non-Aggression Pact:
A strict non-aggression clause was implemented, forbidding Overworld Lords from engaging in combat against each other. This clause aimed to prevent internal conflicts that could weaken the Lords' collective ability to respond to external threats or the Guardian's actions.
While the Lords were not required to actively assist one another, the prohibition of inter-lord combat sought to foster a stable and peaceful environment, reducing the wasteful expenditure of resources and lives on internal strife.

3 Regular Summits:
The establishment of regular summits was agreed upon to maintain open lines of communication among the Lords. These meetings were intended to serve as platforms for dialogue, conflict resolution, and strategic planning, emphasizing diplomacy over warfare.
The summits would also facilitate discussions on collective security, economic cooperation, and provide updates on how each Overworld Lord was faring.

This comprehensive treaty aimed not only to adjust the political landscape but also to ensure a collective defense and a prosperous coexistence under the looming presence and unpredictable influence of the Guardian. By fostering a unified front and encouraging diplomatic engagement, Bell's vision sought to usher in a new era of stability and growth for the realms of Grymmwald, guiding the Lords away from their previously fractious and conflict-driven interactions.
