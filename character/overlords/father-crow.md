When Father Crow was a child, the **God of the Abyss** attempted to use him as a vessel.

### **Mini Story**
Father Crow—one of the most powerful, dangerous, and cruel overlords you will ever face—was not always that way. Once, he was known as Gabriel, a creative and joyful child born into the wrong crow clan.
Back in the days of the Crow King, the crow people were divided into clans. Gabriel belonged to the Hoga Rath, the clan of warriors. But unlike the others, Gabriel studied magic, not combat. For that, he was relentlessly bullied—by his parents, his brothers, and nearly every other crow in the clan.
Only two spared him. His sister Lila, who left the clan when Gabriel was seven due to its cruelty, and one brother, Jakob, who admired Gabriel’s knowledge of magic but did little to protect him.
As time passed, Gabriel’s heart filled with rage and sorrow. He didn’t blame the crows. He blamed the Crow King, who had forged a cruel and unforgiving society. And so, at the age of eleven, Gabriel left home, wandering the world alone.
After nearly a year, voices began whispering in his mind. They promised strength, vengeance, and power. He followed the whispers until he reached a glowing green pool, within which a creature waited—the God of the Abyss.
The Abyss god promised him power, freedom from pain, and a path to revenge—if only Gabriel would help set him free. Without hesitation, Gabriel agreed, allowing the abyss to enter his mind.
The god believed the boy would be easy to control—a child, after all, should be malleable. But he was wrong. Inside Gabriel burned anger, hatred, and a darkness deeper than the void itself.
They say if you stare into the abyss, the abyss corrupts you. But when Gabriel stared into it… he corrupted the abyss.
With his newfound power, Gabriel began preparing. For twenty years, he trained in the shadows, growing stronger. And when the time came, he returned to the Crow Kingdom.
But fate threw him a moment of light. As he passed an old crow woman struggling on the roadside, Gabriel—out of instinct—helped her. And in that instant, something flickered inside him: a spark of light in the darkness.
This light changed him. He abandoned his plan for revenge and instead formed a resistance, determined to purify the crows. He took the name Father Crow, believing he could guide his people to a better future.
But the resistance was weak. The king’s army crushed them. His followers were captured, and Father Crow was banished. He begged for their lives—but the king wanted a show. An example. One by one, his followers were executed before his eyes.
And in that moment, as the last head fell, Father Crow stopped crying.
His tears dried. His heart emptied. A smile crept across his face—not the grin of a madman, but the expression of a soul finally freed from empathy. In that instant, he became pure darkness.
He walked away.
He found a cave, made sure he was alone, and meditated—diving deep into his mind where he once again met the God of the Abyss. Without hesitation, he attacked. Blow after blow, he punished the god for deceiving him. The god pleaded. He claimed that giving Gabriel all his power at once would have killed him.
Father Crow, sensing the lie, tightened his grip, choking the god until he turned pale.
Then, the Abyss god gasped out a final offer: a halberd, hidden and ancient, that held the power Father Crow truly sought.
Father Crow let go.
The God of the Abyss, weakened and breathless, drew a map—etched into the very air of the dream realm—leading to the weapon Father Crow sought: the Halberd of the Abyss.
Father Crow awoke in the cave. He rose in silence, eyes glowing with renewed purpose, and began his journey.
For eleven months, he followed the path laid before him. Along the way, assassins, warriors, and fools hungry for glory tried to stop him. But none were a match. Each encounter ended the same: blood on the blade, silence in the wind.
At last, he arrived at the Temple of the Abyss, a forgotten ruin buried beneath shadow and time. As his hand closed around the halberd, a pulse of abyssal energy exploded across the land—like a scream muffled by the void.
Only two beings cared for it.
One was the King of the Crows, perched high in his obsidian tower.
The other was the Gargantura.
He no longer sought resistance—he demanded allegiance. For a full year, he scoured the lands, challenging every warrior, beast, and creature he could find. If they failed to meet his standards, he killed them without hesitation. If they survived, they were recruited into his army.
To ensure their loyalty, he gave each a crow mask, cursed to never come off. If removed, death would follow within a day.
But as his army grew, two eyes began watching him.
One was powerful—so powerful that even Father Crow could not ignore its presence.
 The other was weak, barely worth noticing—but it never blinked.
For months, he tried to shake them off, sending scouts and casting spells, but nothing worked. Wherever he went, they followed. Silently. Patiently.
Eventually, he wandered to the cold mountains of Beedavilan, a place of emptiness, snow, and wind so sharp it could carve bone. The weak gaze disappeared in the frozen silence, but the stronger presence drew nearer.
Sensing a battle, Father Crow sat cross-legged in the snow, meditating to locate the source.
But he was already too late.
Two minutes later, the snow around him cracked.
Before him stood the Gargantura.Without hesitation, Father Crow struck—a perfect slash meant to bisect the beast in a single motion. And it did. For a moment.
But when he turned to look, the Gargantura was already healing, its body knitting itself back together at an alarming rate.
It turned its head and let out a roar of pure flame, purple fire spewing toward Father Crow like the breath of a dying star.
He dodged, barely.
And so the battle began.
It raged for hours, perhaps days. Father Crow cut, slashed, burned, and cursed the beast. He called upon abyssal magic, tried to erase it from existence, and even dismembered it repeatedly.
But nothing worked.
The Gargantura not only healed—it adapted, growing faster, smarter, and more relentless with each blow.
Father Crow, for the first time in many years, felt something unfamiliar: doubt.
He whispered to himself, blood running down his mask, breath heavy:
“What are you?”
For the first time in decades, Father Crow questioned everything.
Could this be a battle he could not win? Could this be a fate even he couldn’t escape?
Nothing he did slowed the beast. No spell, no slash, no trick of the abyss made a difference. The Gargantura was relentless—a nightmare given form.
And in that moment of doubt, just a second of hesitation…
…it was enough.
The creature lunged, a blur of purple and fury, and Father Crow misstepped, his blade cutting through nothing but air. He realized too late.
The Gargantura struck, slamming into him like a mountain set in motion. Its claws ripped through his defenses and sent him flying, body skidding across the frozen earth before coming to a halt in a heap of black feathers and blood.
Snow scattered around him like shattered glass.
He lay there, face down, pain blooming in places he hadn’t felt in years. The halberd of the abyss had slipped from his grasp, half-buried in the snow some meters away.
Above him, the sky was a dull, pale gray—silent, indifferent.
And for a moment, the great Father Crow… didn’t move.
The wind howled. The snow fell.
And the Gargantura stepped forward, slowly, patiently—like it had all the time in the world to finish what it started.
The Gargantura stepped forward—calm, measured, certain. It knew victory was seconds away.
And for the first time since becoming Father Crow, he felt something he thought had died long ago:
Fear.
His heart pounded. His breath was shallow. The world slowed.
Was this how it ended?
Visions flickered before his eyes—moments from a broken childhood, his sister Lila’s final goodbye, Jakob’s silent admiration, the betrayal of the Crow King, the first spark of rebellion… and the many lives he took in the name of a future no one believed in but him.
And then—one image cut through it all.
A dagger, resting in his hand, long ago plucked from the corpse of a battlefield. It had belonged to a demon—one he had spared, for reasons he still didn’t understand. He had almost forgotten about it… but it never left his side.
The handle was rough. The edge, jagged. But it glowed faintly, humming with unspent power.
Something inside him snapped back into place.
Father Crow’s eyes lit with purpose.
As the Gargantura raised its claws for the final blow, Father Crow rolled sideways, gritted his teeth, and plunged the dagger deep into the beast’s gut.
The blade sank like it belonged there.
The creature’s eyes widened in shock. Then—a scream, raw and thunderous, shook the mountains. The Gargantura staggered back, clawing at the wound. But it was too late.
The ground beneath it cracked, splitting open as a portal to Hell ripped through reality, howling and furious.
And before the creature could react—it fell in, vanishing into the swirling void.
Gone.
Just like that.
Father Crow dropped to his knees, blood soaking the snow, staring at the open wound in the earth as it slowly sealed shut.
He couldn’t believe it.
Not just that he survived…
But that he lived through a battle he could not win.
For a moment, there was only silence.
Then, he began to laugh—not out of joy, but exhaustion. A rasping, bitter laugh that steamed in the cold air.
As the last ember of the abyssal portal faded, Father Crow tried to breathe—just once—as if it would all settle.
But peace never came.
A voice, deep and amused, echoed in his mind:
"Well done, kid. I didn’t think you’d survive that. That beast... it was truly unkillable. But don’t celebrate just yet—"
The voice shifted, a hint of concern now seeping into it.
"It seems like the weaker eyes found us too… And one of them—one of them managed to hide their presence from both of us."
Father Crow’s expression darkened.
He stood, halberd in hand, eyes scanning the horizon. And then, through the falling snow, seven figures emerged—moving like shadows against the pale backdrop.
Seven crows.
Three of them were strangers—warriors, clearly hardened, possibly spies or hunters of the Crow King.
But the other four?
His grip tightened.
He knew them.
He remembered them.
Not as warriors.
 Not as threats.
 But as ghosts from a nightmare childhood.
The ones who had mocked him, spit on him, laughed as he tried to practice his spells. The ones who had told him magic was for cowards. The ones who helped push him away from his clan, from his family, from mercy.
Their faces hadn't changed—only aged. But their cruelty lived in his memory sharper than any blade.
One of them sneered.
“So the little mage survived the mountains? And here we thought you’d be buried under snow like the mistake you always were.”
Another leaned on a jagged blade, grinning.
“Funny how the weak ones always come back thinking they’re strong.”
Father Crow didn’t answer.
His gaze moved from one face to the next. He could feel the abyss inside him whispering, hungry, ready.
But just as the tension neared its breaking point, a voice cut through the cold air.
“Hold it, boys.”
One of the crows Father Crow didn’t recognize—an older one, cloaked in dark feathers and wisdom—raised his hand calmly.
“He may look weak and beaten, but take one step too close… and he’ll kill you. So, I’ll be the one to handle him.”
The other crows paused as the old crow stepped forward slowly, each movement measured, deliberate. He stopped just short—a single step away from death. Father Crow’s fingers twitched on the halberd’s shaft.
But instead of attacking, the old crow simply looked into his eyes—and then turned around.
“On second thought… the one who might die today is you four.”
Gasps broke the silence. The two unknown crows beside him stiffened in shock.
“Master… what are you saying?” asked one of them.
The old crow—Osricain—smiled.
“He’s the one I’ve been searching for. The only one who can kill the Crow King and take his place.”
Father Crow narrowed his eyes, unsure whether this was a trick, a trap… or something else.
The four familiar crows, the ones from his past, looked stunned.
“Master Osricain!” one of them barked. “What is the meaning of this betrayal?”
Osricain turned to them with bored disdain.
“I’m tired of the king’s games. And I think it's time for a change”
He glanced over his shoulder.
“Lu. Ozarix. I know you feel the same.”
Ozarix, a lean crow with sharp eyes, drew his blade and gave a respectful nod.
“Not exactly the way I imagined it, Master… but if this is your wish, I’d be honored to help you realize it. Just say the word—and I’ll silence these fools.”
But Osricain raised a hand.
“No need. If they have even a shred of sense left, they’ll join us.”
One of the old bullies spat on the snow.
“We will never follow a traitor like you!”
Osricain sighed.
“What a shame.”
With a sudden blur of motion, he moved like a shadow with steel, and in a single sweeping motion, cut all four down.
Blood stained the snow. Silence returned.
Then Osricain turned to Father Crow with a shrug.
“Oh… my apologies. Were you hoping to do that?”
He smirked.
“Old habits. Couldn’t help myself.”
“And why should I trust you?” Father Crow asked coldly, his halberd still dripping with melting snow and old blood.
 “Who said I want to take over after we kill the king?”
 His voice was low, sharp, and heavy with the weight of everything he’d endured.
Osricain smiled—not with mockery, but with the quiet satisfaction of someone who had expected the question.
“Well, you already said we,” he said. “But that’s the fun of it... you shouldn’t.”
He took a slow step closer, arms hanging loosely at his sides.
“But I’ll promise you this—I hate the king as much as you do. Maybe more.
 I’ve watched him rot our people from the inside for decades.
 I’ve seen what he twists loyalty into. What he twists strength into.”
His voice dropped, heavier now.
“Besides... I read your file. I know who you are. I know what you want.”
Father Crow’s eyes narrowed.
 “You think you know what I want?”
Osricain gave a dry, quiet chuckle.
“No, not really. But if I had to guess? You want vengeance, sure—but not just revenge.
 You want to tear down the system that raised you to suffer. You want to replace it.
 Or maybe... maybe you just want to burn it all to the ground.
 Honestly? I don’t really care.”
He tilted his head slightly, tone unreadable.
“I only want the king dead. What comes next? That’s up to you.
 And whatever it is... I know it won’t be boring.”
He turned, the snow crunching under his boots as he looked out at the cold white mountains.
“If you’re in, we leave in tomorrow  days. That should give you enough time to rest, recover, and decide what kind of monster you want to be when the kingdom falls.”
Father Crow’s grip on the halberd tightened slightly. His voice was calm, but edged like a blade left too long in frost.
