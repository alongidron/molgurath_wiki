### **Mini Story**
Father Crow—one of the most powerful, dangerous, and cruel overlords you will ever face—was not always that way. Once, he was known as Gabriel, a creative and joyful child born into the wrong crow clan.
Back in the days of the Crow King, the Crow people were divided into clans. Gabriel belonged to the Hoga Rath, the clan of warriors. But unlike the others, Gabriel studied magic, not combat. For that, he was relentlessly bullied by his parents, his brothers, and nearly every other crow in the clan.
Only two spared him. His sister Lila, who left the clan when Gabriel was seven due to its cruelty, and one brother, Jakob, who admired Gabriel’s knowledge of magic but did little to protect him.
As time passed, Gabriel’s heart filled with rage and sorrow. He didn’t blame the crows. He blamed the Crow King, who had forged a cruel and unforgiving society. And so, at the age of eleven, Gabriel left home, wandering the world alone.
After nearly a year, voices began whispering in his mind. They promised strength, vengeance, and power. He followed the whispers until he reached a glowing green pool, within which a creature waited—the God of the Abyss.
The Abyss god promised him power, freedom from pain, and a path to revenge—if only Gabriel would help set him free. Without hesitation, Gabriel agreed, allowing the abyss to enter his mind.
The god believed the boy would be easy to control—a child, after all, should be malleable. But he was wrong. Inside Gabriel burned anger, hatred, and a darkness deeper than the void itself.
They say if you stare into the abyss, the abyss corrupts you. But when Gabriel stared into it… he corrupted the abyss.
With his newfound power, Gabriel began preparing. For twenty years, he trained in the shadows, growing stronger. And when the time came, he returned to the Crow Kingdom.
But fate threw him a moment of light. As he passed an old crow-woman struggling on the roadside, Gabriel—out of instinct—helped her. And in that instant, something flickered inside him: a spark of light in the darkness.
This light changed him. He abandoned his plan for revenge and instead formed a resistance, determined to purify the crows. He took the name Father Crow, believing he could guide his people to a better future.
But the resistance was weak. The king’s army crushed them. His followers were captured, and Father Crow was banished. He begged for their lives—but the king wanted a show. An example. One by one, his followers were executed before his eyes.
And in that moment, as the last head fell, Father Crow stopped crying.
His tears dried. His heart emptied. A smile crept across his face—not the grin of a madman, but the expression of a soul finally freed from empathy. In that instant, he became pure darkness.
He walked away.
He found a cave, made sure he was alone, and meditated—diving deep into his mind where he once again met the God of the Abyss. Without hesitation, he attacked. Blow after blow, he punished the god for deceiving him. The god pleaded. He claimed that giving Gabriel all his power at once would have killed him.
Father Crow, sensing the lie, tightened his grip, choking the god until he turned pale.
Then, the Abyss god gasped out a final offer: a halberd, hidden and ancient, that held the power Father Crow truly sought.
Father Crow let go.
The God of the Abyss, weakened and breathless, drew a map—etched into the very air of the dream realm—leading to the weapon Father Crow sought: the Halberd of the Abyss.
Father Crow awoke in the cave. He rose in silence, eyes glowing with renewed purpose, and began his journey.
For eleven months, he followed the path laid before him. Along the way, assassins, warriors, and fools hungry for glory tried to stop him. But none were a match. Each encounter ended the same: blood on the blade, silence in the wind.
At last, he arrived at the Temple of the Abyss, a forgotten ruin buried beneath shadow and time. As his hand closed around the halberd, a pulse of abyssal energy exploded across the land—like a scream muffled by the void.
Only two beings cared for it.
One was the King of the Crows, perched high in his obsidian tower.
The other was the Gargantura.
He no longer sought resistance—he demanded allegiance. For a full year, he scoured the lands, challenging every warrior, beast, and creature he could find. If they failed to meet his standards, he killed them without hesitation. If they survived, they were recruited into his army.
To ensure their loyalty, he gave each a crow mask, cursed to never come off. If removed, death would follow within a day.
But as his army grew, two eyes began watching him.
One was powerful—so powerful that even Father Crow could not ignore its presence.
 The other was weak, barely worth noticing—but it never blinked.
For months, he tried to shake them off, sending scouts and casting spells, but nothing worked. Wherever he went, they followed. Silently. Patiently.
Eventually, he wandered to the cold mountains of Beedavilan, a place of emptiness, snow, and wind so sharp it could carve bone. The weak gaze disappeared in the frozen silence, but the stronger presence drew nearer.
Sensing a battle, Father Crow sat cross-legged in the snow, meditating to locate the source.
But he was already too late.
Two minutes later, the snow around him cracked.
Before him stood the Gargantura. Without hesitation, Father Crow struck—a perfect slash meant to bisect the beast in a single motion. And it did. For a moment.
But when he turned to look, the Gargantura was already healing, its body knitting itself back together at an alarming rate.
It turned its head and let out a roar of pure flame, purple fire spewing toward Father Crow like the breath of a dying star.
He dodged, barely.
And so the battle began.
 It raged for hours, perhaps even days. Father Crow cut, slashed, burned, and cursed the beast. He unleashed abyssal magic, tried to erase it from existence, and even tore it apart limb by limb.
But nothing worked.
The Gargantura not only healed—it adapted, becoming faster, sharper, and more ruthless with every strike. Yet in the end, Father Crow prevailed. From the corpses of his enemies, he had once collected a dagger, and with it, he pierced the creature; a portal opened under the Garantura that sent him to hell.
Father Crow was left broken and bloodied, but the trial was not over. Seven riders approached—crows on horseback. Four of them he recognized from his childhood, though three were strangers to him. Among them was General Osricain. At once, Osricain warned the others not to draw too close, for he alone could sense the terrible power bleeding from Father Crow’s wounded form. When he looked deeper, he knew—this was the crow he had long sought to overthrow the king.
Two of the riders beside Osricain were his loyal students, bound to him regardless of his ambition. The other four, however, branded him a traitor. Osricain gave them one chance to join him. When they refused, he cut them down.
Father Crow, dazed and weakened, struggled to understand. Osricain revealed his intent, urging Father Crow to recover his strength before the task ahead.
When Father Crow woke again, the horses lay dead around him, the battlefield twisted into ruin. Osricain claimed that during his slumber, he had spoken with the god of the abyss. With a gesture, he teleported them to the throne room of the crow king.
General Velterra struck first, swinging his colossal hammer in a crushing arc. He was too slow. Father Crow severed his arm and sent him crashing backward with a savage kick. As he raised his weapon to finish him, a gust of cutting wind forced him aside. Osricain stepped forward, bidding him to leave the battlefield behind and strike only at the king, while he dealt with the rest.
The battle within the throne room ended swiftly once Father Crow gained the upper hand. The king, realizing too late that he had underestimated him, abandoned his crown and fled into the shadows.
When Father Crow returned, the chamber was littered with the defeated. Osricain was nowhere to be seen, and Velterra slumped against the wall, broken but still alive. Father Crow fixed his gaze on him and forced his submission, demanding that every crow be bound with the cursed masks—or suffer the loss of his remaining arm.
With his command delivered, Father Crow turned to a darker purpose. He walked the path back to his childhood home, where his family awaited. One by one, he slaughtered them all, sparing only his brother Jakob, whom he cast into another dimension.
When the blood had settled, he called upon the abyss. With his power, he rebuilt the ruins of his house, reshaping it into a living prison. Into its walls he bound the souls of his family, condemning them to eternal torment. Their hollow corpses he reanimated, forcing them to serve as guardians of their own cursed tomb.
Only then did Father Crow return to his castle, his vengeance complete and his power deepened by the cruelty he had wrought.
As Father Crow returned, disappointment shadowed his face. Velterra had not donned the mask. Instead, he studied it warily, having seen the agony it brought to those who wore it.
Curiosity drove him to question its purpose. Why such torment? Why such resistance in every crow that touched it?
In his rare good mood, Father Crow obliged. The masks, he explained, were forged to bind flesh and soul alike. Once placed upon the head, they connected directly to the brain, searing through nerves with unrelenting pain. Through that bond, Father Crow gained perfect control. Removal was impossible—taking the mask off was no different than tearing out the mind itself, ensuring only death.
But the masks did more than enslave. They tested strength. A crow unworthy of Father Crow’s standard would wear it in vain—their eyes would remain dark, lifeless. Only those whose gaze burned with an abyssal glow would be deemed strong enough to endure.
The explanation unsettled Velterra further. The thought of surrendering both his freedom and his mind left him colder than the pain itself. Instead, he offered Father Crow a bargain. As long as his true arm remained severed, he would devote himself to service—no matter how cruel or meaningless the task.
Father Crow considered the offer and, amused by its humility, accepted. He then gave Velterra his first command: to gather those whose eyes did not glow beneath the masks, and shape them into an army. Not soldiers of glory, but a legion of the broken—an army of failure, bound in darkness to serve his growing empire.
Then Father Crow returned to his throne room, its doors groaning open beneath his touch. The moment he stepped inside, steel cut through the air—a blade hurled with deadly precision. It missed him by an inch, striking the stone wall.
Osricain stood before him, seething with fury. His voice was sharp, his anger clear. He condemned Father Crow’s recklessness, questioning how he could possibly safeguard the empire. With the king of crows gone, the overlords would surely descend upon them, and Father Crow’s idea of defense was, in Osricain’s eyes, nothing short of disastrous.
Father Crow, unshaken, sought to ease his concerns. He summoned forth those allies he had gathered during his years of exile, champions who had bent to his power and carried his mark. Osricain was not impressed at first, but as his gaze lingered on a few familiar faces, he conceded. They were strong enough—for now.
Days later, the throne room was disturbed once again. This time, by Velmora, an overlord whose power was greater than Father Crow had imagined. Their clash was immediate and merciless, and within moments she had driven him to the brink of death. But before the final strike could fall, Osricain intervened, forcing her back.
Velmora’s expression shifted. She stepped beyond her fury, acknowledging Father Crow as the new ruler. With a smile as sharp as her blade, she promised to spread the word to the other overlords, ensuring they would not rise against him. But Father Crow’s warning was cold—if she did not strike him down now, he would one day kill her. Velmora only shrugged, dismissive, before vanishing into the shadows with a careless wave.
In the silence that followed, Father Crow sat upon his throne, a new ambition burning within him. It was no longer enough to command the crows, nor to hold his fractured empire. From that day onward, his path was set—he would rise beyond them all. He would become the most powerful overlord.
To accomplish his new ambition, Father Crow knew he had to expand his empire, grow his armies, and strengthen himself beyond measure. His first step was conquest. He spread his dominion outward, striking down rival overlords who stood in his way. One by one, he slaughtered them—seven in total—each death claimed by his own hand.
The conquered were not given freedom. Those who survived were shackled beneath his will, forced to wear his cursed masks. In their pain and obedience, his army swelled. But Father Crow sought more than numbers—he demanded order. To enforce this, he established a hierarchy of ranks:
Soldiers—each strong enough to kill a bear.


Commanders—warriors capable of felling a dragon.


Generals—leaders whose strength could crush entire armies.


Winged Generals—the pinnacle of his forces, beings powerful enough to bring down cities.


Father Crow’s hunger for strength did not stop with conquest. He collected weapons from fallen enemies, studying their designs, their flaws, and their potential. Through this pursuit, he came to a grim conclusion: the rapier, delicate and demanding, was the most difficult weapon to master. And so he made it his chosen blade, forcing his body and skill to bend to its ruthless precision.

To ensure his Winged Generals remained worthy of their station, he imposed two cruel tests.
First: They were forbidden from wielding more than seventy percent of their strength in battle. If they could not dominate their enemies with such restraint, then they were unfit to hold the title—and unworthy to serve him. Mercy was never the lesson; mastery was.
Second: From time to time, each Winged General was forced to face him directly. These duels were not meant to be won—only survived. To endure even a fraction of his abyssal might and rise again was proof of their strength. To falter was proof of their weakness.
Over the years, Father Crow’s insatiable hunger for power became a problem for all who dwelled within the realms. Creatures whispered of him with dread, plotted his assassination, and poured their hatred into death wishes against his name. Yet none succeeded.
To wish for Father Crow’s death demanded a price—a sacrifice no desperate soul could truly afford. Still, the closest attempt came when one dared to wish him bound in ropes upon a set of rails, with a train charged with enough power to kill him rushing forward. It was a simple wish, almost crude in its design, but deadly all the same. At the last instant, Father Crow broke free, escaping the fate meant to claim him.
But the attempts only grew more desperate, especially after the tale of the warrior. Father Crow had found him on a distant island, a man of strength who impressed even him. When asked to join, the warrior refused. In response, Father Crow erased all life upon the island—every creature, every plant—leaving the warrior in a wasteland of silence. The warrior chose death over servitude, but Father Crow was not merciful. He sent one of his generals to keep the man alive for fifty years, forcing him to endure endless solitude until he finally broke. At last, the warrior surrendered and swore allegiance.
That single act sent shockwaves through the higher planes. Gods themselves, angered and horrified, banded together against him. Yet where divinity seethed, death itself was pleased. Death admired the cruelty, the relentlessness, the certainty of Father Crow’s dominion—and in turn, Death rewarded him.
Death rewarded Father Crow three times, each gift deepening his dominion.
First, Death bound the souls of his fallen soldiers to him. When they died, they did not pass to the afterlife but remained tethered, stored for later use as Father Crow saw fit.
Second, Death crafted for him two spliced crows—perfect assassins capable of killing any target. Yet their existence was fleeting; once they struck, they vanished, and Death would not remake them until he had gathered enough power from souls. He warned Father Crow to unleash them only when no other path to victory remained.
Third, Death placed in his hand a blackened orb pulsing with necrotic power. Within it lay the essence of death itself, a seed from which Father Crow could shape a Death General, a servant whose strength would rival entire armies.
For a time, these gifts cemented his power. But not all saw war as the answer. A diplomatic overlord named Bell sent Father Crow a peace deal. At first, Father Crow ignored it. Bell, insulted, struck at him while he was already locked in battle against another overlord. Outnumbered and his forces wavering, Father Crow relented and agreed to hear Bell’s terms.
He traveled to the gathering where Bell and the other local overlords awaited to sign the accord. Father Crow nearly set his name to the parchment—until he saw Velmora seated among them. Rage rose in him, and he nearly drew his weapon to begin another war.
Before blood could spill, the air shifted. From the shadows came the demon god Charly, who insisted that a deal must be struck. With his authority, he rewrote the pact, carving slight but crucial changes to sway Father Crow into agreement:
He would be permitted to walk the inner ring, but could only claim broken souls to strengthen his army.


He was free to act as he saw fit if challenged by another creature.


He would be granted a special alcohol potent enough to affect even a crow.


He would be allowed one sanctioned duel to the death with Velmora, under Charly’s watchful eye.


The changes were acceptable. Father Crow pressed his claw to the parchment and signed, binding himself to the accord—but also securing freedoms that would fuel his rise even higher.
Once all the overlords had signed their accords, Charly snapped his fingers. An arena of shadow and fire erupted around them, startling both Father Crow and Velmora. Charly demanded their duel be settled immediately.
The two clashed without restraint. Their battle raged long, each strike shaking the walls of the conjured coliseum. At last, Father Crow prevailed, striking Velmora down. Yet before the dust settled, Charly revived her. Father Crow was dissatisfied with this outcome, but accepted it—it was better than nothing.
Over the years that followed, Charly’s pact ushered in an uneasy peace. He hosted tournaments where overlords could vent their power upon one another. More often than not, Father Crow was the victor, and the balance held. Life grew so stable that even Father Crow allowed himself small indulgences, taking days off to drink in Charly’s bars.
But peace never lasted. One evening, as he sat drinking, assassins struck. It irritated him to spill blood on a day meant for leisure, but he dispatched them with ease. As he left the bar, another challenger awaited him—Willow.
She was far stronger than Father Crow had anticipated. Forced to sober himself quickly, he engaged her in a serious fight. Midway through, his strike went astray and tore into the bar itself. The ground quaked as the establishment began to sink. In his confusion, he noticed the bartender watching him calmly.
The man spoke once: Charly’s message. Father Crow was no longer welcome in his bars. Then, with a wave, the bartender vanished, and the bar itself dissolved into nothing.
Rage consumed Father Crow. He turned his fury toward Willow, but she had already slipped away. Furious, he unleashed a single abyssal blast that leveled everything within a three-mile radius. Still unsatisfied, he returned to his castle and dispatched assassins to hunt her down. Days passed, and none returned with success.
But then Charly’s messenger appeared before Father Crow. With a sly grin, the envoy delivered the offer: in exchange for enough souls, Charly was willing to sell him the hatchhole.
Father Crow wasted no time. He sent his generals to raid both heaven and hell, scouring every battlefield, every forgotten rift, and every underworld vault to collect the currency of souls. The campaign was swift and merciless. When they returned, they brought with them a hoard vast enough to shake the balance of realms.
Among them was a prize that stunned even Father Crow—Lilith’s soul. Without hesitation, he bound it into his service, shaping her essence into one of his own soldiers.
Yet as his gaze lingered on his growing army, another thought pierced his mind. Willow still lived. The memory of her defiance and the insult she carried burned in him like a wound unhealed.
And so, leaving his generals to secure the souls, Father Crow went out himself. He would find her. He would end her.
As he moved through a forest, the air grew heavy with presence. There, upon the path, he was confronted by the god of knowledge—Oboo.
Father Crow struggled against Oboo. The god of knowledge was not only a masterful fighter but also one who could see into the future. Every strike Father Crow attempted was predicted and avoided, leaving him exhausted and frustrated.
It took time, but eventually Father Crow uncovered the truth of Oboo’s defense—he did not attack because every vision of counterstrike ended in his own death. Armed with this knowledge, Father Crow changed tactics. Instead of conserving strength, he unleashed only his most devastating blows. Each one was fatal if it landed, forcing Oboo to dodge again and again. Yet Father Crow layered these strikes with deception: following every killing blow with a weaker attack that Oboo never foresaw as the true threat. Piece by piece, those smaller wounds accumulated, tipping the balance.
But just as Father Crow gained the upper hand, the Dark Guardian entered the fray. The tide shifted instantly. Now forced onto the defensive, Father Crow gave ground, his abyssal power straining as he dodged relentless assaults from both opponents.
Then his sharp eyes caught it—an old scar across the Dark Guardian’s body, a weakness left behind from a past battle. Father Crow seized the chance. He created the opening he needed, feigning retreat before surging forward with all his strength. His strike landed with perfect precision, driving abyssal power into the wound. The Dark Guardian collapsed, slain by the sheer force of the blow.
Oboo was devastated when he saw the Dark Guardian fall. His grief left him exposed long enough for Father Crow to recover his strength. But sorrow quickly turned to fury. Filled with rage, Oboo hurled himself at Father Crow, forcing the battle to continue. It dragged on for a time, until at last Father Crow seized an opening and raised his weapon for the killing blow.
Before it could land, Oboo vanished.
Father Crow believed victory was his. Worn and bloodied, he collapsed beneath the shade of a tree to rest. But fate had other designs. Another god of knowledge, Shiashlian, appeared in that moment and struck. With a single act of divine will, he transformed Father Crow into a child, erasing all memory of who he truly was.
Shiashlian believed he could redeem him, raise him anew without the corruption of cruelty and abyssal power. For one hundred and sixty years, the plan seemed to succeed. Father Crow grew gentle, his mind cleansed of bloodlust.
Until the day he wandered to a lake. The waters shimmered like the abyss he had once commanded. Staring into its depths, his true self awakened. Memories returned in a surge of darkness, and with them, his hunger for power.
He summoned his halberd, but in his child’s form it was too heavy to wield. Instinct forced him to his rapier. To his surprise, its speed and precision far surpassed his old weapon. With that revelation, he struck swiftly and without mercy, cutting Shiashlian down.
As the god’s body crumpled, something stirred within Father Crow. Two new powers unfurled:
The ability to change his age at will.


The ability to alter his appearance, wearing any face he desired.


Before he could revel in these gifts, Zila—the goddess of the undead—appeared before him. She banished him to hell, sentencing him to trial.
The judgment was grim. Guilty of countless crimes, he was condemned to infinite death. The sentence decreed that he would face every creature he could not kill, and in each trial, he would die by their hand. Yet the devil could find only three hundred such beings. To fill eternity, he crafted endless scenarios, each like the death wishes once cast upon Father Crow—but this time, they killed him for real.
Death came again and again. By the time he had suffered 123,000 deaths, the devil himself came to visit.
The devil came to Father Crow with an offer. His demon gods had returned from death, but they no longer obeyed him. Instead, they grew lazy, unruly, and insolent. The devil wanted them destroyed—and he wanted Father Crow to lead the slaughter.
He promised Father Crow two months to prepare his army. If he succeeded, the sentence of infinite death would be reduced greatly. Father Crow agreed without hesitation. With that, the devil returned him to his castle.
When Father Crow stepped into his domain, chaos greeted him. His lower generals mistook him for an intruder and attacked, but his Winged Generals alone knelt, recognizing their true master’s presence. As he advanced into the throne room, he was met with an unexpected sight: a clone of himself sitting upon the throne.
The Winged Generals explained. During his absence, a human had arisen, a man who, through some strange and impossible means, had become the equal of Father Crow in form and aura. They had used him to keep order, knowing only the true Father Crow could stride through the castle unhindered by their attacks.
Fascinated by this anomaly, Father Crow chose not to kill the human but to keep him alive, intrigued by what power could create such a reflection of himself.
Then he gave his command. All territories were to be abandoned if necessary, and every soldier and creature brought together. Victory was not optional—it was absolute. His generals protested, warning that relinquishing lands would weaken their grasp, but Father Crow silenced them. Conquest could wait. Survival and triumph came first.
And so they gathered. Even those once branded as traitors, like Koronis and Byleistr, returned to serve under him once more. From the shadows also came Gaster Stone, the demon lord, pledging his strength to Father Crow’s cause.
A storm was gathering, and Father Crow meant to meet it with everything he had.
For two months, Father Crow prepared. Every soldier was positioned, every strategy laid bare. The day of reckoning arrived, and he was ready to face all fourteen demon gods.
But only eleven appeared.
The absence was unexpected, yet it tilted the scales slightly in his favor. Seizing the moment, Father Crow struck first. With brutal precision, he cut down five of the demon gods before they could even raise their guard.
Then Charly acted. With a single devastating strike, he annihilated Father Crow’s archers, throwing the battlefield into chaos. It was the signal for the remaining four demon gods to advance, and soon they clashed with Father Crow’s army in a storm of fire and shadow.
Leaving the melee behind, Father Crow confronted Charly directly. The duel began in his favor; he pressed close, never allowing the demon god enough space to weave his spells. Charly faltered, struggling to force distance between them. But at last, he found his chance.
With a surge of abyssal might, Charly conjured a barrier, holding Father Crow back long enough to cast a powerful spell. It struck like a thunderclap, forcing Father Crow to retreat. For the first time, Charly stood at full height, hurling spells that tore through the air. The tide shifted—wounds opened on Father Crow’s body as Charly pressed the attack.
When Father Crow’s blood was spilled across the ground, Charly seized it. He tried to drink it, hoping to wield Father Crow’s abyssal magic against him. But Father Crow reacted faster, shattering the glass before it touched his lips.
Charly snarled, readying another spell—when a blast struck him from the side. Gaster Stone had entered the fray, alongside a moon demon whose magic roared like a storm. Together, they overwhelmed Charly, and with a final eruption of energy, the demon god was cast from the battlefield.
Father Crow returned to the chaos of the war, only to find that Staticus and Nightmare were nowhere to be seen. Of the demon gods who remained, only Mammon and Leviathan still fought. Leviathan fell swiftly, his bulk crashing into the earth. Mammon resisted longer, but in the end, he too was broken.
At last, the battle was over. Father Crow summoned his generals, his shadow stretching across the battlefield, to take account of the survivors and the dead.
Father Crow was disappointed when the battlefield was tallied. The number of his generals had been reduced, and the strength of his army weakened. Turning to the human Caleb—the one who had served as his stand-in—Father Crow declared that he would take command once more. Caleb was tasked with recapturing any lost territories.
Caleb tried to reason with him, explaining that with so few generals left, the task might be impossible. But Father Crow would hear none of it. His command was absolute: Caleb would find a way to succeed, no matter the cost.
With that settled, Father Crow went to meet the devil. Though the battle was over, he knew the truth—those demon gods were not truly dead. They had only been shadows of their former selves, and he longed for the day he could face them at their full strength.
But the devil’s words cut into him. He explained that if even one of the demon gods had fought in their true power, Father Crow would not have survived. The truth angered him, and he burned to lash out, but before he could speak a word, the devil cast him back into torment.
Two more weeks passed in endless suffering. Then, at last, Father Crow was released.
When Father Crow returned to his castle, something felt wrong. A presence lingered that did not belong. He searched until he found it: a blooming garden sprouting in the very heart of his fortress. Roses, moon lilies, and thorned vines coiled around two chairs and a tea table.
Seated there, sipping calmly, was Zila—the Witch Goddess of the Undead.
Annoyance flared in Father Crow, and he attacked her outright, only to be halted by her strange explanation. She claimed she merely wished to share tea. Confused and unwilling to waste time, he ignored her and turned his attention to his generals.
Caleb, shaken by his sudden return, admitted progress was still incomplete. Most territories had been reclaimed, but fifteen generals were faltering, and five more were missing—two confirmed dead. Father Crow masked his rage, sending Caleb to aid the struggling fifteen. But once Caleb departed, he turned on his generals.
He demanded to know why none had acted against the intruding witch. One answered, hesitantly, that they assumed she was fulfilling her godly duty, since two generals’ souls had already been taken. That answer only deepened his fury. Without hesitation, he slew the speaker and commanded the rest to find replacements for the fallen. Each was ordered to bring their strongest warriors before him.
When they departed, his thoughts circled back to Zila. Convinced she was lying, he returned to her garden and attacked again—only to feel the chill of souls nearby. In the heat of battle, Zila silently pointed behind him.
Father Crow turned.
A nightmarish creature loomed, strangling two souls in its claws. Rage consumed him. Dropping his weapon, he lunged barehanded, beating the abomination until it crumpled lifeless. Spattered in blood, he returned to Zila’s tea table. She remained seated, unmoved, as if nothing had changed. Exhausted, he relented and shared her tea. Only afterward did he order her to disable her traps before leaving. She obeyed, vanishing as quietly as she had come.
Still burning with fury, Father Crow hunted down the creature’s kin and unleashed his vengeance, leaving nothing but ruin. Days later, he summoned his generals once more. Caleb admitted all territory had been reclaimed—except for one region, where a single warrior resisted. Anger flashed again, but Father Crow let it pass, noting the progress. He declared he would deal with the warrior himself.
The warrior proved to be no mere fighter, but the Overlord known as the Desert King. Their battle shook the sands. Despite Father Crow’s abyssal might, the Desert King triumphed. Father Crow, stunned by the king’s strength, withdrew with cold words of apology for his generals’ reckless attempt to challenge such a foe.
When he returned to his castle, his fury fell on Caleb. He slammed him to the ground for failing to mention that the warrior was an overlord. Yet his temper cooled when the generals returned with their chosen warriors. To his surprise, all survived his brutal trials.
From that day forward, Father Crow abandoned his grand schemes of conquest. Instead, he sank into a rotten, twisted routine:
Once a month, he met with Zila, sharing bitter tea and stranger conversations among her invasive gardens.


Almost daily, he wandered ruined lands, hunting broken things—shattered souls, malformed beasts, cursed wanderers. Anything fractured enough to mold.


Relentlessly, he forced his generals to present their champions for bloody trials, each test designed to scar them deeper.


Whenever a Winged General fell, another was chosen—through blood, violence, or betrayal.


His name became more than a title. It became a warning.
Legends whispered:
 If you see him—hide.
 If he sees you—pray.
 And if he’s interested in you… run.
But the darkest whisper of all was reserved for the desperate.
 Those broken enough to beg for one last chance, those who would do anything to rise again—
They knew the truth.
 Father Crow would find them.
