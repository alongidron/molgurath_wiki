### **Mini Story**
Father Crow—one of the most powerful, dangerous, and cruel overlords you will ever face—was not always that way. Once, he was known as Gabriel, a creative and joyful child born into the wrong crow clan.
Back in the days of the Crow King, the crow people were divided into clans. Gabriel belonged to the Hoga Rath, the clan of warriors. But unlike the others, Gabriel studied magic, not combat. For that, he was relentlessly bullied—by his parents, his brothers, and nearly every other crow in the clan.
Only two spared him. His sister Lila, who left the clan when Gabriel was seven due to its cruelty, and one brother, Jakob, who admired Gabriel’s knowledge of magic but did little to protect him.
As time passed, Gabriel’s heart filled with rage and sorrow. He didn’t blame the crows. He blamed the Crow King, who had forged a cruel and unforgiving society. And so, at the age of eleven, Gabriel left home, wandering the world alone.
After nearly a year, voices began whispering in his mind. They promised strength, vengeance, and power. He followed the whispers until he reached a glowing green pool, within which a creature waited—the God of the Abyss.
The Abyss god promised him power, freedom from pain, and a path to revenge—if only Gabriel would help set him free. Without hesitation, Gabriel agreed, allowing the abyss to enter his mind.
The god believed the boy would be easy to control—a child, after all, should be malleable. But he was wrong. Inside Gabriel burned anger, hatred, and a darkness deeper than the void itself.
They say if you stare into the abyss, the abyss corrupts you. But when Gabriel stared into it… he corrupted the abyss.
With his newfound power, Gabriel began preparing. For twenty years, he trained in the shadows, growing stronger. And when the time came, he returned to the Crow Kingdom.
But fate threw him a moment of light. As he passed an old crow woman struggling on the roadside, Gabriel—out of instinct—helped her. And in that instant, something flickered inside him: a spark of light in the darkness.
This light changed him. He abandoned his plan for revenge and instead formed a resistance, determined to purify the crows. He took the name Father Crow, believing he could guide his people to a better future.
But the resistance was weak. The king’s army crushed them. His followers were captured, and Father Crow was banished. He begged for their lives—but the king wanted a show. An example. One by one, his followers were executed before his eyes.
And in that moment, as the last head fell, Father Crow stopped crying.
His tears dried. His heart emptied. A smile crept across his face—not the grin of a madman, but the expression of a soul finally freed from empathy. In that instant, he became pure darkness.
He walked away.
He found a cave, made sure he was alone, and meditated—diving deep into his mind where he once again met the God of the Abyss. Without hesitation, he attacked. Blow after blow, he punished the god for deceiving him.
