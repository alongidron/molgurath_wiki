## **Origin**
When Father Crow was a child, the **God of the Abyss** attempted to use him as a vessel.

### **Mini Story**
Father Crow—one of the most powerful, dangerous, and cruel overlords you will ever face—was not always that way. Once, he was known as Gabriel, a creative and joyful child born into the wrong crow clan.
Back in the days of the Crow King, the crow people were divided into clans. Gabriel belonged to the Hoga Rath, the clan of warriors. But unlike the others, Gabriel studied magic, not combat. For that, he was relentlessly bullied—by his parents, his brothers, and nearly every other crow in the clan.
Only two spared him. His sister Lila, who left the clan when Gabriel was seven due to its cruelty, and one brother, Jakob, who admired Gabriel’s knowledge of magic but did little to protect him.
As time passed, Gabriel’s heart filled with rage and sorrow. He didn’t blame the crows. He blamed the Crow King, who had forged a cruel and unforgiving society. And so, at the age of eleven, Gabriel left home, wandering the world alone.
After nearly a year, voices began whispering in his mind. They promised strength, vengeance, and power. He followed the whispers until he reached a glowing green pool, within which a creature waited—the God of the Abyss.
The Abyss god promised him power, freedom from pain, and a path to revenge—if only Gabriel would help set him free. Without hesitation, Gabriel agreed, allowing the abyss to enter his mind.
The god believed the boy would be easy to control—a child, after all, should be malleable. But he was wrong. Inside Gabriel burned anger, hatred, and a darkness deeper than the void itself.
They say if you stare into the abyss, the abyss corrupts you. But when Gabriel stared into it… he corrupted the abyss.
With his newfound power, Gabriel began preparing. For twenty years, he trained in the shadows, growing stronger. And when the time came, he returned to the Crow Kingdom.
But fate threw him a moment of light. As he passed an old crow woman struggling on the roadside, Gabriel—out of instinct—helped her. And in that instant, something flickered inside him: a spark of light in the darkness.
This light changed him. He abandoned his plan for revenge and instead formed a resistance, determined to purify the crows. He took the name Father Crow, believing he could guide his people to a better future.
But the resistance was weak. The king’s army crushed them. His followers were captured, and Father Crow was banished. He begged for their lives—but the king wanted a show. An example. One by one, his followers were executed before his eyes.
And in that moment, as the last head fell, Father Crow stopped crying.
His tears dried. His heart emptied. A smile crept across his face—not the grin of a madman, but the expression of a soul finally freed from empathy. In that instant, he became pure darkness.
He walked away.
He found a cave, made sure he was alone, and meditated—diving deep into his mind where he once again met the God of the Abyss. Without hesitation, he attacked. Blow after blow, he punished the god for deceiving him. The god pleaded. He claimed that giving Gabriel all his power at once would have killed him.
Father Crow, sensing the lie, tightened his grip, choking the god until he turned pale.
Then, the Abyss god gasped out a final offer: a halberd, hidden and ancient, that held the power Father Crow truly sought.
Father Crow let go.
The God of the Abyss, weakened and breathless, drew a map—etched into the very air of the dream realm—leading to the weapon Father Crow sought: the Halberd of the Abyss.
Father Crow awoke in the cave. He rose in silence, eyes glowing with renewed purpose, and began his journey.
For eleven months, he followed the path laid before him. Along the way, assassins, warriors, and fools hungry for glory tried to stop him. But none were a match. Each encounter ended the same: blood on the blade, silence in the wind.
At last, he arrived at the Temple of the Abyss, a forgotten ruin buried beneath shadow and time. As his hand closed around the halberd, a pulse of abyssal energy exploded across the land—like a scream muffled by the void.
Only two beings cared for it.
One was the King of the Crows, perched high in his obsidian tower.
The other was the Gargantura.
He no longer sought resistance—he demanded allegiance. For a full year, he scoured the lands, challenging every warrior, beast, and creature he could find. If they failed to meet his standards, he killed them without hesitation. If they survived, they were recruited into his army.
To ensure their loyalty, he gave each a crow mask, cursed to never come off. If removed, death would follow within a day.
But as his army grew, two eyes began watching him.
One was powerful—so powerful that even Father Crow could not ignore its presence.
 The other was weak, barely worth noticing—but it never blinked.
For months, he tried to shake them off, sending scouts and casting spells, but nothing worked. Wherever he went, they followed. Silently. Patiently.
Eventually, he wandered to the cold mountains of Beedavilan, a place of emptiness, snow, and wind so sharp it could carve bone. The weak gaze disappeared in the frozen silence, but the stronger presence drew nearer.
Sensing a battle, Father Crow sat cross-legged in the snow, meditating to locate the source.
But he was already too late.
Two minutes later, the snow around him cracked.
Before him stood the Gargantura.Without hesitation, Father Crow struck—a perfect slash meant to bisect the beast in a single motion. And it did. For a moment.
But when he turned to look, the Gargantura was already healing, its body knitting itself back together at an alarming rate.
It turned its head and let out a roar of pure flame, purple fire spewing toward Father Crow like the breath of a dying star.
He dodged, barely.
And so the battle began.
It raged for hours, perhaps days. Father Crow cut, slashed, burned, and cursed the beast. He called upon abyssal magic, tried to erase it from existence, and even dismembered it repeatedly.
But nothing worked.
The Gargantura not only healed—it adapted, growing faster, smarter, and more relentless with each blow.
Father Crow, for the first time in many years, felt something unfamiliar: doubt.
He whispered to himself, blood running down his mask, breath heavy:
“What are you?”
For the first time in decades, Father Crow questioned everything.
Could this be a battle he could not win? Could this be a fate even he couldn’t escape?
Nothing he did slowed the beast. No spell, no slash, no trick of the abyss made a difference. The Gargantura was relentless—a nightmare given form.
And in that moment of doubt, just a second of hesitation…
…it was enough.
The creature lunged, a blur of purple and fury, and Father Crow misstepped, his blade cutting through nothing but air. He realized too late.
The Gargantura struck, slamming into him like a mountain set in motion. Its claws ripped through his defenses and sent him flying, body skidding across the frozen earth before coming to a halt in a heap of black feathers and blood.
Snow scattered around him like shattered glass.
He lay there, face down, pain blooming in places he hadn’t felt in years. The halberd of the abyss had slipped from his grasp, half-buried in the snow some meters away.
Above him, the sky was a dull, pale gray—silent, indifferent.
And for a moment, the great Father Crow… didn’t move.
The wind howled. The snow fell.
And the Gargantura stepped forward, slowly, patiently—like it had all the time in the world to finish what it started.
The Gargantura stepped forward—calm, measured, certain. It knew victory was seconds away.
And for the first time since becoming Father Crow, he felt something he thought had died long ago:
Fear.
His heart pounded. His breath was shallow. The world slowed.
Was this how it ended?
Visions flickered before his eyes—moments from a broken childhood, his sister Lila’s final goodbye, Jakob’s silent admiration, the betrayal of the Crow King, the first spark of rebellion… and the many lives he took in the name of a future no one believed in but him.
And then—one image cut through it all.
A dagger, resting in his hand, long ago plucked from the corpse of a battlefield. It had belonged to a demon—one he had spared, for reasons he still didn’t understand. He had almost forgotten about it… but it never left his side.
The handle was rough. The edge, jagged. But it glowed faintly, humming with unspent power.
Something inside him snapped back into place.
Father Crow’s eyes lit with purpose.
As the Gargantura raised its claws for the final blow, Father Crow rolled sideways, gritted his teeth, and plunged the dagger deep into the beast’s gut.
The blade sank like it belonged there.
The creature’s eyes widened in shock. Then—a scream, raw and thunderous, shook the mountains. The Gargantura staggered back, clawing at the wound. But it was too late.
The ground beneath it cracked, splitting open as a portal to Hell ripped through reality, howling and furious.
And before the creature could react—it fell in, vanishing into the swirling void.
Gone.
Just like that.
Father Crow dropped to his knees, blood soaking the snow, staring at the open wound in the earth as it slowly sealed shut.
He couldn’t believe it.
Not just that he survived…
But that he lived through a battle he could not win.
For a moment, there was only silence.
Then, he began to laugh—not out of joy, but exhaustion. A rasping, bitter laugh that steamed in the cold air.
As the last ember of the abyssal portal faded, Father Crow tried to breathe—just once—as if it would all settle.
But peace never came.
A voice, deep and amused, echoed in his mind:
"Well done, kid. I didn’t think you’d survive that. That beast... it was truly unkillable. But don’t celebrate just yet—"
The voice shifted, a hint of concern now seeping into it.
"It seems like the weaker eyes found us too… And one of them—one of them managed to hide their presence from both of us."
Father Crow’s expression darkened.
He stood, halberd in hand, eyes scanning the horizon. And then, through the falling snow, seven figures emerged—moving like shadows against the pale backdrop.
Seven crows.
Three of them were strangers—warriors, clearly hardened, possibly spies or hunters of the Crow King.
But the other four?
His grip tightened.
He knew them.
He remembered them.
Not as warriors.
 Not as threats.
 But as ghosts from a nightmare childhood.
The ones who had mocked him, spit on him, laughed as he tried to practice his spells. The ones who had told him magic was for cowards. The ones who helped push him away from his clan, from his family, from mercy.
Their faces hadn't changed—only aged. But their cruelty lived in his memory sharper than any blade.
One of them sneered.
“So the little mage survived the mountains? And here we thought you’d be buried under snow like the mistake you always were.”
Another leaned on a jagged blade, grinning.
“Funny how the weak ones always come back thinking they’re strong.”
Father Crow didn’t answer.
His gaze moved from one face to the next. He could feel the abyss inside him whispering, hungry, ready.
But just as the tension neared its breaking point, a voice cut through the cold air.
“Hold it, boys.”
One of the crows Father Crow didn’t recognize—an older one, cloaked in dark feathers and wisdom—raised his hand calmly.
“He may look weak and beaten, but take one step too close… and he’ll kill you. So, I’ll be the one to handle him.”
The other crows paused as the old crow stepped forward slowly, each movement measured, deliberate. He stopped just short—a single step away from death. Father Crow’s fingers twitched on the halberd’s shaft.
But instead of attacking, the old crow simply looked into his eyes—and then turned around.
“On second thought… the one who might die today is you four.”
Gasps broke the silence. The two unknown crows beside him stiffened in shock.
“Master… what are you saying?” asked one of them.
The old crow—Osricain—smiled.
“He’s the one I’ve been searching for. The only one who can kill the Crow King and take his place.”
Father Crow narrowed his eyes, unsure whether this was a trick, a trap… or something else.
The four familiar crows, the ones from his past, looked stunned.
“Master Osricain!” one of them barked. “What is the meaning of this betrayal?”
Osricain turned to them with bored disdain.
“I’m tired of the king’s games. And I think it's time for a change”
He glanced over his shoulder.
“Lu. Ozarix. I know you feel the same.”
Ozarix, a lean crow with sharp eyes, drew his blade and gave a respectful nod.
“Not exactly the way I imagined it, Master… but if this is your wish, I’d be honored to help you realize it. Just say the word—and I’ll silence these fools.”
But Osricain raised a hand.
“No need. If they have even a shred of sense left, they’ll join us.”
One of the old bullies spat on the snow.
“We will never follow a traitor like you!”
Osricain sighed.
“What a shame.”
With a sudden blur of motion, he moved like a shadow with steel, and in a single sweeping motion, cut all four down.
Blood stained the snow. Silence returned.
Then Osricain turned to Father Crow with a shrug.
“Oh… my apologies. Were you hoping to do that?”
He smirked.
“Old habits. Couldn’t help myself.”
“And why should I trust you?” Father Crow asked coldly, his halberd still dripping with melting snow and old blood.
 “Who said I want to take over after we kill the king?”
 His voice was low, sharp, and heavy with the weight of everything he’d endured.
Osricain smiled—not with mockery, but with the quiet satisfaction of someone who had expected the question.
“Well, you already said we,” he said. “But that’s the fun of it... you shouldn’t.”
He took a slow step closer, arms hanging loosely at his sides.
“But I’ll promise you this—I hate the king as much as you do. Maybe more.
 I’ve watched him rot our people from the inside for decades.
 I’ve seen what he twists loyalty into. What he twists strength into.”
His voice dropped, heavier now.
“Besides... I read your file. I know who you are. I know what you want.”
Father Crow’s eyes narrowed.
 “You think you know what I want?”
Osricain gave a dry, quiet chuckle.
“No, not really. But if I had to guess? You want vengeance, sure—but not just revenge.
 You want to tear down the system that raised you to suffer. You want to replace it.
 Or maybe... maybe you just want to burn it all to the ground.
 Honestly? I don’t really care.”
He tilted his head slightly, tone unreadable.
“I only want the king dead. What comes next? That’s up to you.
 And whatever it is... I know it won’t be boring.”
He turned, the snow crunching under his boots as he looked out at the cold white mountains.
“If you’re in, we leave in tomorrow. That should give you enough time to rest, recover, and decide what kind of monster you want to be when the kingdom falls.”
Father Crow’s grip on the halberd tightened slightly. His voice was calm, but edged like a blade left too long in frost.
With a blur of motion and a shimmer of magic, the king vanished into one of the hidden escape routes carved into the throne’s foundations, leaving only a silence behind… and his crown, rolling across the blood-slick floor.
Father Crow stood alone, chest rising with slow, heavy breaths.
He walked forward and picked up the crown.
Not in triumph.
 Not in ceremony.
 But like lifting a weapon.
He turned to leave.
But a voice stopped him.
The maimed guard, half-sitting against a crumbled pillar, blood still leaking from his stump, sneered through clenched teeth.“Fine. I’ll help you. But on one condition…”
He looked Osricain straight in the eyes.
“Tell me why you want to kill him.”
Osricain blinked, then chuckled.
“Oh? So the abyss inside you doesn’t get the last word after all. Interesting. Looks like you’re the one still holding the reins.”
He folded his arms, the cold wind pulling at his feathered cloak.
“Alright. I’ll keep it simple.”
His tone dropped, sharp now. Honest.
“First—he killed a good friend of mine. One of the few I actually respected. Not for power. Not for rank. Just... a good crow. Gone for daring to question a command.”
A pause.
“Second—he destroyed what the Crow Kingdom used to be. We were a people of shadow and brilliance. Now? We're pawns. Broken feathers and blind obedience.”
Father Crow tilted his head, watching Osricain with cautious interest.
“Oh, I see…”
His voice was calm, but laced with skepticism.
“Then what is your plan exactly?”
Osricain smiled—but this time, it was more calculated than amused.
“Just rest for now. You’ve earned it.”
He turned slightly, already walking away.
“Tomorrow, before we move out… I’ll share the plan with you.”
Osricain looked back one last time, his cloak fluttering like a shadow in the snow.
“I promise I won’t kill you in your sleep. I’m not a coward.”
There was no smirk this time. Just flat, honest words.
Father Crow stared at him for a long moment. Then, without replying, he sat down in the snow, halberd resting beside him.
And for the first time in what felt like ages, he slept—not as a warrior, not as a weapon, but as something caught between man and monster.
When the morning came, the air was different.
Colder.
And around him, the snow had been shredded, as if something massive had passed through during the night. Broken stones, scorch marks, and jagged gouges in the earth told the story of a silent battle—one that didn’t wake him.
Father Crow rose slowly, scanning the destruction.
Then he heard Osricain’s voice, casual as ever.
“Don’t worry about it.”
He stood at the edge of the camp, arms crossed, watching the horizon.
“Just had a little conversation with your… other half. He’s very friendly, once you get past the soul-eating stare.”
Father Crow turned sharply.
“You spoke to the Abyss God?”
Osricain shrugged.
“Spoke? I guess you could say that… more or less.”
Osricain rolled his shoulders. “He’s a scary one.”
He turned to the horizon, as the snow began to lighten with the morning glow.
“Well then… now that you’re awake—”
He paused and glanced back, voice calm but pointed.
“Do you feel ready to fight?”
Father Crow stood tall, halberd in hand, cloak heavy with frost but his presence unmistakably intact. The wounds from the Gargantura still ached, but the fire in his chest—the abyssal pulse—beat stronger than ever.
“Ready?”
A shadow flickered in his eyes.
“I was born in a battlefield… I never stopped.”
Osricain smirked, satisfied.
“Good. Well then…”
He snapped his fingers.
In a blink, the world twisted. Wind howled, light shattered—and then they were inside the throne room of the Crow King.
A blast of abyssal energy and teleportation magic dropped the entire group into the heart of enemy power, catching the guards completely off guard.
Shouts echoed. Blades were drawn. The king rose from his obsidian throne, startled—but not yet afraid.
Osricain’s voice cut through the chaos.
“*You take the king—*we’ll deal with the rest!”
Before Father Crow could even react, one of the royal guards, a towering brute wielding a giant warhammer, charged—eyes locked on him like a predator spotting prey.
The hammer came crashing down with impossible force.
But Father Crow moved faster.
With a smooth, precise slash, he severed the guard’s hand, the weapon clanging against the stone floor. Blood sprayed across the tiles.
Father Crow raised his halberd for the finishing blow—
 But suddenly, the guard was blasted away by a fierce gust of wind, slammed into a pillar with a sickening crunch.
Father Crow turned sharply—confused.
“What—”
“I said I’ll handle the others!” Osricain shouted, hands glowing with wind magic. “Just kill the damn king!”
There was no time to argue, no time to question.
The room was already a warzone. Crow guards pouring in from the halls. Osricain, Lu, and Ozarix already clashing with elite defenders in a storm of steel and feathers.
Father Crow turned back.
The Crow King now stood tall, black crown gleaming, feathers lined with silver, his presence imposing. His greatsword gleamed with ancient power as he blocked the halberd with a heavy, practiced strike.
“So,” the king growled, voice like cold iron, “the little mage returns… with a name and a weapon that doesn’t belong to him.”
Their blades clashed, metal singing as sparks flew.
 The ground cracked beneath them.
And the battle began.
The clash of blades rang loud through the throne room—but it didn’t last long.
The Crow King underestimated him.
He expected the boy he once cast out. He wasn’t ready for the abyss-forged fury Father Crow had become.
Every strike from the halberd was faster, heavier, more precise than the king could handle. The king blocked one blow too slow, staggered back, and the next hit shattered his guard.
Panic flickered in the king’s eyes.
And then—he fled.

“So what if you have the crown? You’ll never be king. Not you.”
Father Crow paused.
Then turned slowly.
His steps were quiet. Final.
He walked over, grabbed the guard by the throat, and lifted him into the air with ease.
The halberd still in one hand. The crown in the other.
His voice was calm—too calm.
“Oh really?”
He started walking again, dragging the guard along like a sack of feathers.
“Then follow me.”

Father Crow walked through the palace halls, the severed-armed guard still dangling from his grip, until he reached the royal balcony overlooking the central courtyard.
Below, a massive crowd of crows had gathered—soldiers, citizens, nobles. Word of the king’s defeat had spread like fire in dry feathers. They had come for answers, for leadership… or perhaps, just for spectacle.
When Father Crow stepped out onto the balcony, silence fell like a blade.
No sound.
 No breath.
 Only the wind whispering through feathers.
Then, slowly, he raised the crown.
At first—cheers erupted, deafening and wild. Applause, screams of victory, and chants of his name.
 “Father Crow! Father Crow!”
But then—
The abyssal magic, hidden within the crown, activated.
A pulse—dark, silent, and unseen by the eye—spread like a wave across the courtyard, binding every crow below to the abyss. Not killing them… not yet. But marking them. Changing them. Controlling them.
The cheers turned to screams. Some collapsed. Some clutched their heads. A few fled in panic.
But most… stood still, stunned by the foreign power now woven into their very being.
Father Crow turned to the mutilated guard beside him and dropped him to the floor with a heavy thud. He handed him a black sack, tied with crimson cord.
“Seeing how you reacted to me… I’d wager you’re some kind of leader. Maybe even a general.”
He leaned in slightly.
“I want you and your people to make sure every single crow—every one of them—wears this mask. Including you.”
The guard looked inside the bag. Inside were dozens of black, abyss-marked crow masks—each cursed, each permanent.
“And if I don’t?” the guard spat, defiant even in pain.
Father Crow smiled, just a little.
“Then I take your other arm. And this time…”
 “You’ll feel five times the pain.”
The guard trembled, then lowered his head, resigned.
“…And where are you going, if I may ask… my lord?”
Father Crow turned toward the horizon. His voice was calm, distant.
“Oh… just a little family execution.”
Father Crow walked the old path to his former home,He made no attempt to hide himself.
He wanted them to see him coming.
And they did.
Word spread fast. The Hoga Rath clan—warriors to the core—armed themselves, feeling a familiar, suffocating fear in their bones.
That fear had a name.
And when they stepped outside, when they saw the figure standing in the yard of their ancestral grounds, tall and cloaked in darkness—
They froze.
The figure slowly reached up…
…and removed his mask.
Gabriel.
Older. Harder. Colder.
But unmistakably him.
Their long-banished disgrace had returned—no longer a boy, no longer an outcast.
A silence fell over the clan's courtyard. Then, rage broke it.
His mother, still as fierce and proud as ever, stepped forward, hate in her eyes.
“You dare come back here?”
His brothers, armored and snarling, drew their weapons without hesitation. One spat at the ground, the other cursed his name.
“We should’ve finished you when you were a freak with books!”
Blades were drawn, spears leveled.
But two did not move.
Jakob, his once-silent supporter, now stood speechless—his blade still sheathed, staring at the abyss his brother had become.
And beside him, their father, no longer the towering warrior he once was, but still a man of presence. His eyes, worn and tired, didn’t hold anger… only shock.
He spoke, voice cracked but steady.
“Gabriel… what have you become?”
Father Crow looked at his father—no smile, no hate.
Only the cold, quiet resolve of a man who had buried the child he once was.
“Exactly what you always wanted—”
His voice echoed through the courtyard like a verdict.
“A strong warrior. One powerful enough to kill a king.”
He took a slow step forward, halberd glinting with abyssal power.
“Now I’ll prove it.”
His gaze swept across the yard, locking eyes with each of them—his mother, his brothers, the warriors of his bloodline who once mocked his spells and kicked dust on his name.
“Let me show you—”
His voice dropped into a low growl.
“—how I alone… can kill all nine of you.”
The wind picked up. Shadows seemed to ripple unnaturally around him, coiling like serpents. The abyss stirred—hungry, eager to feed on what remained of the bloodline that had cast him out.
His brothers charged first, roaring with fury, blades raised.
But Father Crow didn’t flinch.
The courtyard erupted into chaos.
And the execution began.
The first brother lunged, roaring with a twin-axe strike aimed for Father Crow’s neck.
Without a word, Father Crow sidestepped, the halberd swinging in a crescent arc that cleaved through both axes—and his brother’s chest, sending him crashing to the ground in a spray of blood.
The second brother followed immediately, sword overhead in a downward slash.
Father Crow raised his halberd, catching the blade mid-air—then twisted, snapping the sword in half and driving his boot into the brother’s knee. As the bone shattered, the halberd came down, splitting his skull with ruthless precision.
Two down.
The third tried to flank him with a spear—smart, from a distance.
Father Crow spun the halberd like a cyclone, deflecting the spear with practiced ease. In one fluid motion, he caught the shaft mid-thrust, yanked the attacker forward, and drove the blade deep into the crow’s throat, twisting viciously before shoving him off.
Three down.
But then—movement behind him. Shadows shifting.
The family’s butlers, trained assassins, made a desperate attempt to strike from behind. Quick. Silent. Efficient.
But Gabriel saw it coming.
Without turning, he unleashed a wave of abyssal energy, a shockwave of black tendrils that ripped through them like paper. Limbs flew, screams choked on blood, and within seconds—all were dead.
No hesitation. No mercy.
His father, sword still gripped tightly, stood frozen—shocked.
Not just by the power.
By the cold precision.
By how the boy they abandoned had become a monster not even their war-hardened legacy could match.
“Gabriel…” his voice was low, grave. “Using magic isn’t what makes a warrior weak. It’s relying only on magic… That’s not why you were built.”
Gabriel—no, Father Crow—turned to him slowly.
His voice was calm, almost amused.
“Is that so?”
The shadows curled tighter around him, the abyss humming with restrained fury.
“Well then, Father…”
He lifted his hand, abyssal power crackling in his palm, raw and unstable.
“Allow me to show you what real magic looks like.”
With a thrust of his hand, he unleashed a wave of destructive energy, a wide arc of pure abyssal force—laced with fire, shadow, and soul-rending weight.
Jakob didn’t block it.
 Because Gabriel aimed around him—on purpose.
His mother and father, standing beside Jakob, raised their weapons and braced—blocking the blow, barely surviving as it slammed into them with the force of a crashing world.
The shockwave shattered the courtyard, breaking pillars, cracking stone.
Two of his younger brothers didn’t react in time. The blast hit them full-on—obliterating them instantly, their bodies reduced to ash and shadow.
From behind the smoke, one voice emerged.
Eldor—his oldest brother—staggered out, his armor cracked, his eyes burning with rage.
He had survived.
But only barely.
The rest of the butlers, those hiding in the shadows, were gone. Vaporized.
Gabriel lowered his hand.
Only Jakob, Eldor, and their parents remained.
The storm was nearly over.
Gabriel’s father stood firm despite the burns on his armor, the strain in his voice revealing the weight of his words.
His eyes, once full of pride and command, now brimmed with horror—and grief.
“Gabriel… the magic you’re using—it’s evil. It’s corrupted. It’s twisting you into something you're not.”
He raised his sword, trembling only slightly now.
“But it’s not too late. I’m going to save you from it… even if it means killing you.”
A long pause. Then, his voice softened.
“I just want you to know—no matter what happens, I always loved you.”
He turned his gaze to the last of his warriors.
“Honny, Eldor… let’s finish this.”
He looked to Jakob—still frozen in place.
“Jakob, snap out of this! That’s not your brother anymore. It’s a monster.”
His voice cracked.
“Either run far from here… or help us purify his poor soul.”
The courtyard fell still again.
Gabriel, face unreadable, stood tall—halberd pulsing with abyssal flame, his cloak still billowing in the ruinous wind he’d summoned.
Eldor stepped forward, sword in both hands, eyes locked on Gabriel with burning intensity.
His armor was scorched, his cloak torn, but his posture held the unmistakable strength of a seasoned warrior. He didn’t speak—he let his blade do the talking.
Their mother, blood running down her temple, took her place opposite him, daggers in hand once more.
Their father stood at the center, leading the charge, sword gleaming with a holy light he had never used before.
Together, they moved in unison
Just as Gabriel’s halberd was about to fall on his mother—
Three red bolts of energy blasted into his side, sending him skidding across the courtyard.
Jakob, fists trembling with power, stood in a defensive stance. His eyes were desperate—but determined.
Gabriel rose slowly, dust and smoke curling from his shoulders. He cracked his neck and exhaled.
“You know…” he said, voice chillingly calm, “there’s one more trick I’ve been saving.”
He snapped his fingers.
“Boys. Take care of Mother, Father, and Eldor. Don’t kill them… yet.”
From the blood-soaked ground, the bodies of his fallen brothers began to twitch—black tendrils of abyssal magic stitching them back together. One by one, they rose, eyes void of light, now mere vessels of Gabriel’s will.
The courtyard echoed with gasps and screams as the dead obeyed.
Gabriel stepped forward, slow and steady, his eyes fixed on Jakob.
Jakob took a step back.
“Please, Gabriel. Don’t do this. Don’t you think you’ve punished them enough?”
His voice cracked, pleading.
“This isn’t you. This isn’t the little brother I remember.”
Gabriel paused, face hardening.
“Jakob… you’re still just as foolish. Just as weak.”
He raised his hand, fingers twitching with power.
“You were too weak to protect me back then. And now… you’re too weak to fight me.”
His voice dropped cold.
“This isn’t punishment. It’s justice. It’s what they deserve.”
Jakob’s heart ached. Words weren’t reaching him—nothing was.
So he lunged.
Fists blazing with red energy, Jakob attacked in a flurry. Punch after punch aimed with rage and sorrow.
But Gabriel didn’t even flinch.
With one hand, he blocked, parried, and dismantled Jakob’s attacks effortlessly. Then, in one swift motion, he struck Jakob in the chest—a single, crushing blow that sent him crashing to the ground, unconscious.
Gabriel stood over him, eyes distant.
“See? I told you…”
He knelt down.
“You’re too afraid to kill me. And that’s what’s holding you back.”
He stood again and snapped his fingers. A swirling portal of black and green opened behind Jakob’s limp form.
“This portal will take you far from here. Somewhere safe… Somewhere you won’t have to watch what happens next.”
Gabriel looked down one final time.
“But if our paths cross again… don’t stand in my way. I don’t want to have to kill you.”
And with that, he kicked Jakob through the portal. It closed with a quiet hum behind him.
Silence returned to the ruined courtyard.
Gabriel turned his head toward the battlefield, where his resurrected brothers now surrounded his wounded parents and a battered Eldor.
Gabriel turned away from the fading shimmer of the portal, his boots crunching over broken stone and snow-stained blood. The air around him crackled with the lingering residue of abyssal power.
Before him stood the last three members of his family his father, still gripping his sword with both hands, breathing hard; his mother, bleeding and barely standing, but still defiant; and Eldor, the oldest, holding his blade steady, his pride now stripped down to raw fury.
Behind them, the reanimated brothers moved like puppets—soulless, silent, surrounding the trio like vultures waiting for the final twitch of life.
Gabriel raised his hand, and the undead brothers froze instantly—silent, soulless, obedient.
He turned his gaze back to the shattered remnants of his family, eyes settling on his bloodied mother, his shaken father, and a panting Eldor, still standing tall despite the gash across his armor.
Gabriel’s voice echoed through the broken courtyard—calm, collected, deadly.
“Now then…”
He took a step forward, halberd dragging across the stone, sparks trailing behind him.
“Let’s pick up from where we lef off"
He launched forward without warning.
Eldor met him, swords clashing in a violent storm of steel and fury. The air around them cracked with each impact—Eldor’s form fueled by sheer will, Gabriel’s movements driven by years of honed wrath and abyssal strength.
Eldor ducked a wide sweep, cut across Gabriel’s ribs again—more black blood.
But Gabriel didn’t slow.
He caught Eldor’s next swing mid-strike, twisting the sword from his grip and kneeing him in the stomach with brutal force, lifting him off the ground. Eldor collapsed, coughing blood—but still conscious.
Their father charged in, swinging his blade in a clean, righteous arc. Gabriel spun, blocking with the haft of the halberd, then grabbed his father’s arm mid-swing and unleashed a point-blank pulse of abyssal energy, sending the man flying into a cracked wall.
Gabriel turned toward his mother next. Despite her bruised and battered appearance, she still looked ready to fight. In fact, she charged at him without hesitation. At the same moment, his father used his super speed to strike from behind, while Eldor attacked from the front to support his mother. But Gabriel was prepared. With a surge of abyssal green aura, he released a shockwave that knocked back both Eldor and his father.
His mother braced herself, assuming the aura would hit her too and raised her daggers in a defensive stance. But Gabriel had tailored the aura’s force—only Eldor and his father were affected. Before his mother could react or lower her guard, Gabriel moved in with terrifying speed and sliced her and her twin daggers clean in half with his abyss-infused halberd.
Gabriel didn’t stop to look at her.
 He turned—the halberd still dripping—toward the last two.
Eldor and their father, both battered but still alive, rose from the rubble.
Eldor’s eyes were bloodshot, rage and sorrow blending into something wild and desperate. Their father, though older and slower, stood tall—gripping his blade like it was the only thing left keeping him upright.
Gabriel slowly approached.
Eldor charged first, roaring, blade flashing in wide, aggressive sweeps. Gabriel parried each strike with practiced ease—deflecting, redirecting, letting Eldor burn out his strength.
Their father appeared in a blur, trying to flank once more, blade slicing toward Gabriel’s spine.
But this time, Gabriel anticipated it.
With a backward twist of his halberd, he knocked the sword away mid-swing and slammed the pole end into his father's chest, sending him skidding backward.
Eldor, seizing the moment, landed a blow—cutting deep into Gabriel’s side.
Gabriel hissed but didn’t stumble.
Instead, he turned to Eldor with a look that froze the air around them.
“Not bad.”
Gabriel headbutted Eldor, then followed with a bone-crushing knee to the ribs, lifting him off his feet with the sheer force of it. Eldor gasped for air, stunned and broken.
Gabriel grabbed him by the throat, lifting him effortlessly, abyssal energy building in his other hand—ready to end it.
But just as he was about to strike—
Steel flashed.
With a cry of rage, their father struck, and in one swift, brutal move—sliced Gabriel’s arm severing it at the forearms.
Gabriel staggered back, his severed limb falling, blood pouring—black and steaming.
Their father stood tall, his aura now fully unleashed. Gone was the man who held back. What remained was a war-hardened monster, his blade burning with divine energy.
But Gabriel only looked down at his bleeding stumps, exhaled, and then smiled.
“If you wanted to save him…”
 “…you should’ve aimed to kill"
Before his father could react, Gabriel turned back to Eldor, his face expressionless—his fury razor-focused.
Though his hands had been severed, his arm still pulsed with abyssal energy. Eldor still hung by the throat, suspended in the air by Gabriel’s half-healed arm—barely conscious, his body broken and limp.
Gabriel didn’t hesitate.
From the forming stump of his hand, a beam of pure abyssal power burst forth—violent, raw, and point-blank into Eldor
The light swallowed him.
Eldor’s mouth opened in a scream, but no sound escaped. Only the glow.
Then—silence.
No blood. No remains.
Just ash and smoke, swirling away in the breeze.
Eldor was gone.
His father collapsed to his knees, the weight of it all breaking him at last.
Gabriel walked over slowly, his halberd trailing behind like a shadow.
He reached down, picking up his freshly regrown hand from the ground. Fitting it back in place with a sickening snap, he looked down at his father and spoke coldly:
“Don’t feel bad. There was nothing you could’ve done to save him.”
His father, face twisted with grief and rage, raised his sword and lunged again—faster, harder, unleashing everything.
But Gabriel had already adapted.
 Already evolved.
He met his father blow for blow, step for step—until he began pushing him back. Strike after strike, the air itself trembled around them. One parry. Two. A feint. A counter.
Then a lock.
Their weapons clashed—halberd against blade—face to face, close enough to hear each other’s breath.
In a single, fluid motion, Gabriel shifted his stance, broke the lock, and drove his halberd straight through his father's chest, the blade erupting from his back in a violent spray of blood and black light. His father’s sword slipped from his hand. No final words. No last breath. Just a stunned look of realization—this was always how it would end. Gabriel yanked the halberd free. His father dropped to his knees… then fell face-first into the dirt. Dead. The courtyard was silent now.  
Gabriel stood in the middle of the bloodstained courtyard, his halberd now resting quietly in the ground, its edge still glowing with the energy of lives it had ended.
He looked upon the shattered ruins of his household—the home that raised him in scorn, molded him in pain, and discarded him like a mistake.  
He raised a hand, and the abyss answered. Black tendrils surged from the earth, weaving and coiling, rebuilding the house stone by stone—not as it once was, but twisted, corrupted, a monument of torment. The walls pulsed like a living thing, whispers leaking through its cracks. Then Gabriel snapped his fingers once more. From the broken remains of his family—their bodies, bloodied and lifeless—he summoned their souls, binding them in chains of shadow and dragging them into the house. There, within its cursed halls, their spirits were trapped, forced to relive their worst memories, feel every wound, and endure an eternity of pain. An eternal prison, carved from vengeance and sorrow. To ensure it stood forever, Gabriel reanimated their corpses once more—twisted, hollow-eyed guardians—forced to guard their own tomb. Satisfied, Gabriel walked into the shadow of a nearby ridge, sat down beneath a dead tree, and rested. The house behind him echoed with screams—not just cries of pain, but of regret, shame, and madness. And as he closed his eyes, surrounded by the chilling chorus of suffering, Father Crow smiled. Gabriel sat beneath the dead tree, listening to the house behind him breathe and scream. The wind was cold, but to him it felt like nothing—just another part of the silence he now carried within. For a moment, he let the quiet wash over him. He had done what he came for. He had ended the chapter that made him. But then—his eyes opened. “Right… i was at the middle of somthing" He stood up, brushing dust from his armor. With a flick of his hand, he summoned his crow mask, placing it over his face once more. The moment it settled, he wasn’t Gabriel anymore. He was Father Crow again. His voice, his presence, his power—returned to its full weight. He turned his back on the house of suffering, now hidden in the forest behind layers of abyssal wards. A monument to the past, left to rot. As he walked down the hill toward the dark outline of the Crow Kingdom’s capital. 
A cold wind swept through the valley as Father Crow returned to the heart of the Crow Kingdom—the newly claimed capital.
The gates opened before him without resistance. The shadow he cast stretched long across the courtyard stones, and the whispers of power followed his every step.
He made his way to the royal balcony, the place once used by the king to address his people. Now, it belonged to Father Crow.
As he stepped out, he found the courtyard below filled with crows, each of them standing in silent formation, wearing their cursed black masks—except one. next to him stood the crow who had overseen the mask distribution.
He wasn't wearing one.
“Yes, my lord,” he said carefully. “But… when I saw others put on the mask, they screamed in pain—just for a moment—and then some of them… their eyes started to glow. Others didn’t.”
He took a breath.
“I wanted to understand exactly what the mask does before I put it on.”
Father Crow tilted his head—curious, not angry.
“And who are you to question me?”
The guard hesitated.
“If I tell you… will you kill me?”
Father Crow let out a dry chuckle, the wind stirring around his armor.
“No. I’m in a good mood. There’s no need for more blood today.”
The guard nodded and finally stepped forward.
“My name is Velterra. Probably the last surviving member of the Hoga Rath clan, And before you killed the king, I served him as his general.”
A flicker of surprise passed through Father Crow’s eyes—but only for a second.
“Interesting.”
He smiled beneath his mask.
“Oh, you worry too much. I didn’t kill the entire Hoga Rath clan. Just the part that needed to die.”
He gestured to the crowd gathering below.
“As for what the mask does… you’re about to hear.”
Father Crow stepped forward to the edge of the balcony, his abyssal voice booming across the castle grounds like a curse carved into the wind—commanding, echoing, inescapable.

“Crows of the Kingdom!
Thank you for gathering.”

His eyes swept across the masked crowd below.

“By now, most of you have learned two important truths:

One—if you try to take off the mask… you die. So don’t.

Two—some of your eyes glow, and some do not.”

He paused, letting the tension grow.

“Those with glowing eyes… you are free to leave.”

There was a ripple of movement as the glowing-eyed Crows silently turned and began to walk away, fading into the shadows.

Once the last of them was gone, Father Crow’s tone shifted—lower, colder.

“Now then… those of you who stayed…”

He looked down at them with quiet disappointment.

“The reason your eyes don’t glow is simple—you’re weaker than I expected.”

The air tensed.

“But don’t worry. I can fix that.”

A faint grin curled at the corner of his mouth.

“You’ll be thrown into the army.
Through time, battle, and suffering…
you’ll either grow stronger—

—or die.”

He turned away, already finished with them.

“Good luck out there.”

A beat of silence.

“Dismissed.”

Father Crow turned to Velterra, eyes glowing faintly behind the mask.
“So then… will you now be so kind as to put a mask on?”
Velterra didn’t flinch.
“Unfortunately… no. In fact, this whole speech just made me want to wear one even less.”
He stepped closer, his one remaining arm resting at his side, the sleeve of the other neatly pinned.
“But… for sparing my life—and out of respect for what you’ve become—I’ll offer you something better.”
His tone grew sharper.
“For as long as my real arm is gone, I’ll obey every order you give—no matter how brutal, stupid, or suicidal it might be.”
The wind held its breath.
Father Crow blinked, momentarily caught off guard by the blunt honesty. But slowly… a grin curled beneath his mask.
“Hah… now that is a deal I can appreciate.”
He stepped beside Velterra and extended a hand toward the courtyard, gesturing to the mass of masked crows below—the ones whose eyes did not glow.
“Then here is your first task, General.”
His voice dropped into a low, commanding hum.
“See those weaklings down there? you are now thier commander"
Velterra’s eyes widened slightly.
“You want me to train them?”
“yes,” Father Crow said.
“But I want you to protect this kingdom and everyone in it using only them. No elite forces. No glowing eyes. No second chances.”
He leaned in slightly.
“Consider it your punishment… and your test.”
Velterra, after a long pause, let out a single, sharp breath through his nose—half a laugh, half a sigh.
“Understood, my lord.”
And for the first time, he saluted.
Not to a king. Not to a tyrant.
To Father Crow.
The blade embedded itself in the stone just inches from Father Crow’s head, the force of it cracking the floor where it landed.
