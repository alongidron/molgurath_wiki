## **Origin**
When Father Crow was a child, the **God of the Abyss** attempted to use him as a vessel.

### **Mini Story**
Father Crow—one of the most powerful, dangerous, and cruel overlords you will ever face—was not always that way. Once, he was known as Gabriel, a creative and joyful child born into the wrong crow clan.
Back in the days of the Crow King, the crow people were divided into clans. Gabriel belonged to the Hoga Rath, the clan of warriors. But unlike the others, Gabriel studied magic, not combat. For that, he was relentlessly bullied—by his parents, his brothers, and nearly every other crow in the clan.
Only two spared him. His sister Lila, who left the clan when Gabriel was seven due to its cruelty, and one brother, Jakob, who admired Gabriel’s knowledge of magic but did little to protect him.
As time passed, Gabriel’s heart filled with rage and sorrow. He didn’t blame the crows. He blamed the Crow King, who had forged a cruel and unforgiving society. And so, at the age of eleven, Gabriel left home, wandering the world alone.
After nearly a year, voices began whispering in his mind. They promised strength, vengeance, and power. He followed the whispers until he reached a glowing green pool, within which a creature waited—the God of the Abyss.
The Abyss god promised him power, freedom from pain, and a path to revenge—if only Gabriel would help set him free. Without hesitation, Gabriel agreed, allowing the abyss to enter his mind.
The god believed the boy would be easy to control—a child, after all, should be malleable. But he was wrong. Inside Gabriel burned anger, hatred, and a darkness deeper than the void itself.
They say if you stare into the abyss, the abyss corrupts you. But when Gabriel stared into it… he corrupted the abyss.
With his newfound power, Gabriel began preparing. For twenty years, he trained in the shadows, growing stronger. And when the time came, he returned to the Crow Kingdom.
But fate threw him a moment of light. As he passed an old crow woman struggling on the roadside, Gabriel—out of instinct—helped her. And in that instant, something flickered inside him: a spark of light in the darkness.
This light changed him. He abandoned his plan for revenge and instead formed a resistance, determined to purify the crows. He took the name Father Crow, believing he could guide his people to a better future.
But the resistance was weak. The king’s army crushed them. His followers were captured, and Father Crow was banished. He begged for their lives—but the king wanted a show. An example. One by one, his followers were executed before his eyes.
And in that moment, as the last head fell, Father Crow stopped crying.
His tears dried. His heart emptied. A smile crept across his face—not the grin of a madman, but the expression of a soul finally freed from empathy. In that instant, he became pure darkness.
He walked away.
He found a cave, made sure he was alone, and meditated—diving deep into his mind where he once again met the God of the Abyss. Without hesitation, he attacked. Blow after blow, he punished the god for deceiving him. The god pleaded. He claimed that giving Gabriel all his power at once would have killed him.
Father Crow, sensing the lie, tightened his grip, choking the god until he turned pale.
Then, the Abyss god gasped out a final offer: a halberd, hidden and ancient, that held the power Father Crow truly sought.
Father Crow let go.
The God of the Abyss, weakened and breathless, drew a map—etched into the very air of the dream realm—leading to the weapon Father Crow sought: the Halberd of the Abyss.
Father Crow awoke in the cave. He rose in silence, eyes glowing with renewed purpose, and began his journey.
For eleven months, he followed the path laid before him. Along the way, assassins, warriors, and fools hungry for glory tried to stop him. But none were a match. Each encounter ended the same: blood on the blade, silence in the wind.
At last, he arrived at the Temple of the Abyss, a forgotten ruin buried beneath shadow and time. As his hand closed around the halberd, a pulse of abyssal energy exploded across the land—like a scream muffled by the void.
Only two beings cared for it.
One was the King of the Crows, perched high in his obsidian tower.
The other was the Gargantura.
He no longer sought resistance—he demanded allegiance. For a full year, he scoured the lands, challenging every warrior, beast, and creature he could find. If they failed to meet his standards, he killed them without hesitation. If they survived, they were recruited into his army.
To ensure their loyalty, he gave each a crow mask, cursed to never come off. If removed, death would follow within a day.
But as his army grew, two eyes began watching him.
One was powerful—so powerful that even Father Crow could not ignore its presence.
 The other was weak, barely worth noticing—but it never blinked.
For months, he tried to shake them off, sending scouts and casting spells, but nothing worked. Wherever he went, they followed. Silently. Patiently.
Eventually, he wandered to the cold mountains of Beedavilan, a place of emptiness, snow, and wind so sharp it could carve bone. The weak gaze disappeared in the frozen silence, but the stronger presence drew nearer.
Sensing a battle, Father Crow sat cross-legged in the snow, meditating to locate the source.
But he was already too late.
Two minutes later, the snow around him cracked.
Before him stood the Gargantura.Without hesitation, Father Crow struck—a perfect slash meant to bisect the beast in a single motion. And it did. For a moment.
But when he turned to look, the Gargantura was already healing, its body knitting itself back together at an alarming rate.
It turned its head and let out a roar of pure flame, purple fire spewing toward Father Crow like the breath of a dying star.
He dodged, barely.
And so the battle began.
It raged for hours, perhaps days. Father Crow cut, slashed, burned, and cursed the beast. He called upon abyssal magic, tried to erase it from existence, and even dismembered it repeatedly.
But nothing worked.
The Gargantura not only healed—it adapted, growing faster, smarter, and more relentless with each blow.
Father Crow, for the first time in many years, felt something unfamiliar: doubt.
He whispered to himself, blood running down his mask, breath heavy:
“What are you?”
For the first time in decades, Father Crow questioned everything.
Could this be a battle he could not win? Could this be a fate even he couldn’t escape?
Nothing he did slowed the beast. No spell, no slash, no trick of the abyss made a difference. The Gargantura was relentless—a nightmare given form.
And in that moment of doubt, just a second of hesitation…
…it was enough.
The creature lunged, a blur of purple and fury, and Father Crow misstepped, his blade cutting through nothing but air. He realized too late.
The Gargantura struck, slamming into him like a mountain set in motion. Its claws ripped through his defenses and sent him flying, body skidding across the frozen earth before coming to a halt in a heap of black feathers and blood.
Snow scattered around him like shattered glass.
He lay there, face down, pain blooming in places he hadn’t felt in years. The halberd of the abyss had slipped from his grasp, half-buried in the snow some meters away.
Above him, the sky was a dull, pale gray—silent, indifferent.
And for a moment, the great Father Crow… didn’t move.
The wind howled. The snow fell.
And the Gargantura stepped forward, slowly, patiently—like it had all the time in the world to finish what it started.
The Gargantura stepped forward—calm, measured, certain. It knew victory was seconds away.
And for the first time since becoming Father Crow, he felt something he thought had died long ago:
Fear.
His heart pounded. His breath was shallow. The world slowed.
Was this how it ended?
Visions flickered before his eyes—moments from a broken childhood, his sister Lila’s final goodbye, Jakob’s silent admiration, the betrayal of the Crow King, the first spark of rebellion… and the many lives he took in the name of a future no one believed in but him.
And then—one image cut through it all.
A dagger, resting in his hand, long ago plucked from the corpse of a battlefield. It had belonged to a demon—one he had spared, for reasons he still didn’t understand. He had almost forgotten about it… but it never left his side.
The handle was rough. The edge, jagged. But it glowed faintly, humming with unspent power.
Something inside him snapped back into place.
Father Crow’s eyes lit with purpose.
As the Gargantura raised its claws for the final blow, Father Crow rolled sideways, gritted his teeth, and plunged the dagger deep into the beast’s gut.
The blade sank like it belonged there.
The creature’s eyes widened in shock. Then—a scream, raw and thunderous, shook the mountains. The Gargantura staggered back, clawing at the wound. But it was too late.
The ground beneath it cracked, splitting open as a portal to Hell ripped through reality, howling and furious.
And before the creature could react—it fell in, vanishing into the swirling void.
Gone.
Just like that.
Father Crow dropped to his knees, blood soaking the snow, staring at the open wound in the earth as it slowly sealed shut.
He couldn’t believe it.
Not just that he survived…
But that he lived through a battle he could not win.
For a moment, there was only silence.
Then, he began to laugh—not out of joy, but exhaustion. A rasping, bitter laugh that steamed in the cold air.
As the last ember of the abyssal portal faded, Father Crow tried to breathe—just once—as if it would all settle.
But peace never came.
A voice, deep and amused, echoed in his mind:
"Well done, kid. I didn’t think you’d survive that. That beast... it was truly unkillable. But don’t celebrate just yet—"
The voice shifted, a hint of concern now seeping into it.
"It seems like the weaker eyes found us too… And one of them—one of them managed to hide their presence from both of us."
Father Crow’s expression darkened.
He stood, halberd in hand, eyes scanning the horizon. And then, through the falling snow, seven figures emerged—moving like shadows against the pale backdrop.
Seven crows.
Three of them were strangers—warriors, clearly hardened, possibly spies or hunters of the Crow King.
But the other four?
His grip tightened.
He knew them.
He remembered them.
Not as warriors.
 Not as threats.
 But as ghosts from a nightmare childhood.
The ones who had mocked him, spit on him, laughed as he tried to practice his spells. The ones who had told him magic was for cowards. The ones who helped push him away from his clan, from his family, from mercy.
Their faces hadn't changed—only aged. But their cruelty lived in his memory sharper than any blade.
One of them sneered.
“So the little mage survived the mountains? And here we thought you’d be buried under snow like the mistake you always were.”
Another leaned on a jagged blade, grinning.
“Funny how the weak ones always come back thinking they’re strong.”
Father Crow didn’t answer.
His gaze moved from one face to the next. He could feel the abyss inside him whispering, hungry, ready.
But just as the tension neared its breaking point, a voice cut through the cold air.
“Hold it, boys.”
One of the crows Father Crow didn’t recognize—an older one, cloaked in dark feathers and wisdom—raised his hand calmly.
“He may look weak and beaten, but take one step too close… and he’ll kill you. So, I’ll be the one to handle him.”
The other crows paused as the old crow stepped forward slowly, each movement measured, deliberate. He stopped just short—a single step away from death. Father Crow’s fingers twitched on the halberd’s shaft.
But instead of attacking, the old crow simply looked into his eyes—and then turned around.
“On second thought… the one who might die today is you four.”
Gasps broke the silence. The two unknown crows beside him stiffened in shock.
“Master… what are you saying?” asked one of them.
The old crow—Osricain—smiled.
“He’s the one I’ve been searching for. The only one who can kill the Crow King and take his place.”
Father Crow narrowed his eyes, unsure whether this was a trick, a trap… or something else.
The four familiar crows, the ones from his past, looked stunned.
“Master Osricain!” one of them barked. “What is the meaning of this betrayal?”
Osricain turned to them with bored disdain.
“I’m tired of the king’s games. And I think it's time for a change”
He glanced over his shoulder.
“Lu. Ozarix. I know you feel the same.”
Ozarix, a lean crow with sharp eyes, drew his blade and gave a respectful nod.
“Not exactly the way I imagined it, Master… but if this is your wish, I’d be honored to help you realize it. Just say the word—and I’ll silence these fools.”
But Osricain raised a hand.
“No need. If they have even a shred of sense left, they’ll join us.”
One of the old bullies spat on the snow.
“We will never follow a traitor like you!”
Osricain sighed.
“What a shame.”
With a sudden blur of motion, he moved like a shadow with steel, and in a single sweeping motion, cut all four down.
Blood stained the snow. Silence returned.
Then Osricain turned to Father Crow with a shrug.
“Oh… my apologies. Were you hoping to do that?”
He smirked.
“Old habits. Couldn’t help myself.”
“And why should I trust you?” Father Crow asked coldly, his halberd still dripping with melting snow and old blood.
 “Who said I want to take over after we kill the king?”
 His voice was low, sharp, and heavy with the weight of everything he’d endured.
Osricain smiled—not with mockery, but with the quiet satisfaction of someone who had expected the question.
“Well, you already said we,” he said. “But that’s the fun of it... you shouldn’t.”
He took a slow step closer, arms hanging loosely at his sides.
“But I’ll promise you this—I hate the king as much as you do. Maybe more.
 I’ve watched him rot our people from the inside for decades.
 I’ve seen what he twists loyalty into. What he twists strength into.”
His voice dropped, heavier now.
“Besides... I read your file. I know who you are. I know what you want.”
Father Crow’s eyes narrowed.
 “You think you know what I want?”
Osricain gave a dry, quiet chuckle.
“No, not really. But if I had to guess? You want vengeance, sure—but not just revenge.
 You want to tear down the system that raised you to suffer. You want to replace it.
 Or maybe... maybe you just want to burn it all to the ground.
 Honestly? I don’t really care.”
He tilted his head slightly, tone unreadable.
“I only want the king dead. What comes next? That’s up to you.
 And whatever it is... I know it won’t be boring.”
He turned, the snow crunching under his boots as he looked out at the cold white mountains.
“If you’re in, we leave in tomorrow. That should give you enough time to rest, recover, and decide what kind of monster you want to be when the kingdom falls.”
Father Crow’s grip on the halberd tightened slightly. His voice was calm, but edged like a blade left too long in frost.
With a blur of motion and a shimmer of magic, the king vanished into one of the hidden escape routes carved into the throne’s foundations, leaving only a silence behind… and his crown, rolling across the blood-slick floor.
Father Crow stood alone, chest rising with slow, heavy breaths.
He walked forward and picked up the crown.
Not in triumph.
 Not in ceremony.
 But like lifting a weapon.
He turned to leave.
But a voice stopped him.
The maimed guard, half-sitting against a crumbled pillar, blood still leaking from his stump, sneered through clenched teeth.“Fine. I’ll help you. But on one condition…”
He looked Osricain straight in the eyes.
“Tell me why you want to kill him.”
Osricain blinked, then chuckled.
“Oh? So the abyss inside you doesn’t get the last word after all. Interesting. Looks like you’re the one still holding the reins.”
He folded his arms, the cold wind pulling at his feathered cloak.
“Alright. I’ll keep it simple.”
His tone dropped, sharp now. Honest.
“First—he killed a good friend of mine. One of the few I actually respected. Not for power. Not for rank. Just... a good crow. Gone for daring to question a command.”
A pause.
“Second—he destroyed what the Crow Kingdom used to be. We were a people of shadow and brilliance. Now? We're pawns. Broken feathers and blind obedience.”
Father Crow tilted his head, watching Osricain with cautious interest.
“Oh, I see…”
His voice was calm, but laced with skepticism.
“Then what is your plan exactly?”
Osricain smiled—but this time, it was more calculated than amused.
“Just rest for now. You’ve earned it.”
He turned slightly, already walking away.
“Tomorrow, before we move out… I’ll share the plan with you.”
Osricain looked back one last time, his cloak fluttering like a shadow in the snow.
“I promise I won’t kill you in your sleep. I’m not a coward.”
There was no smirk this time. Just flat, honest words.
Father Crow stared at him for a long moment. Then, without replying, he sat down in the snow, halberd resting beside him.
And for the first time in what felt like ages, he slept—not as a warrior, not as a weapon, but as something caught between man and monster.
When the morning came, the air was different.
Colder.
And around him, the snow had been shredded, as if something massive had passed through during the night. Broken stones, scorch marks, and jagged gouges in the earth told the story of a silent battle—one that didn’t wake him.
Father Crow rose slowly, scanning the destruction.
Then he heard Osricain’s voice, casual as ever.
“Don’t worry about it.”
He stood at the edge of the camp, arms crossed, watching the horizon.
“Just had a little conversation with your… other half. He’s very friendly, once you get past the soul-eating stare.”
Father Crow turned sharply.
“You spoke to the Abyss God?”
Osricain shrugged.
“Spoke? I guess you could say that… more or less.”
Osricain rolled his shoulders. “He’s a scary one.”
He turned to the horizon, as the snow began to lighten with the morning glow.
“Well then… now that you’re awake—”
He paused and glanced back, voice calm but pointed.
“Do you feel ready to fight?”
Father Crow stood tall, halberd in hand, cloak heavy with frost but his presence unmistakably intact. The wounds from the Gargantura still ached, but the fire in his chest—the abyssal pulse—beat stronger than ever.
“Ready?”
A shadow flickered in his eyes.
“I was born in a battlefield… I never stopped.”
Osricain smirked, satisfied.
“Good. Well then…”
He snapped his fingers.
In a blink, the world twisted. Wind howled, light shattered—and then they were inside the throne room of the Crow King.
A blast of abyssal energy and teleportation magic dropped the entire group into the heart of enemy power, catching the guards completely off guard.
Shouts echoed. Blades were drawn. The king rose from his obsidian throne, startled—but not yet afraid.
Osricain’s voice cut through the chaos.
“*You take the king—*we’ll deal with the rest!”
Before Father Crow could even react, one of the royal guards, a towering brute wielding a giant warhammer, charged—eyes locked on him like a predator spotting prey.
The hammer came crashing down with impossible force.
But Father Crow moved faster.
With a smooth, precise slash, he severed the guard’s hand, the weapon clanging against the stone floor. Blood sprayed across the tiles.
Father Crow raised his halberd for the finishing blow—
 But suddenly, the guard was blasted away by a fierce gust of wind, slammed into a pillar with a sickening crunch.
Father Crow turned sharply—confused.
“What—”
“I said I’ll handle the others!” Osricain shouted, hands glowing with wind magic. “Just kill the damn king!”
There was no time to argue, no time to question.
The room was already a warzone. Crow guards pouring in from the halls. Osricain, Lu, and Ozarix already clashing with elite defenders in a storm of steel and feathers.
Father Crow turned back.
The Crow King now stood tall, black crown gleaming, feathers lined with silver, his presence imposing. His greatsword gleamed with ancient power as he blocked the halberd with a heavy, practiced strike.
“So,” the king growled, voice like cold iron, “the little mage returns… with a name and a weapon that doesn’t belong to him.”
Their blades clashed, metal singing as sparks flew.
 The ground cracked beneath them.
And the battle began.
The clash of blades rang loud through the throne room—but it didn’t last long.
The Crow King underestimated him.
He expected the boy he once cast out. He wasn’t ready for the abyss-forged fury Father Crow had become.
Every strike from the halberd was faster, heavier, more precise than the king could handle. The king blocked one blow too slow, staggered back, and the next hit shattered his guard.
Panic flickered in the king’s eyes.
And then—he fled.

“So what if you have the crown? You’ll never be king. Not you.”
Father Crow paused.
Then turned slowly.
His steps were quiet. Final.
He walked over, grabbed the guard by the throat, and lifted him into the air with ease.
The halberd still in one hand. The crown in the other.
His voice was calm—too calm.
“Oh really?”
He started walking again, dragging the guard along like a sack of feathers.
“Then follow me.”

Father Crow walked through the palace halls, the severed-armed guard still dangling from his grip, until he reached the royal balcony overlooking the central courtyard.
Below, a massive crowd of crows had gathered—soldiers, citizens, nobles. Word of the king’s defeat had spread like fire in dry feathers. They had come for answers, for leadership… or perhaps, just for spectacle.
When Father Crow stepped out onto the balcony, silence fell like a blade.
No sound.
 No breath.
 Only the wind whispering through feathers.
Then, slowly, he raised the crown.
At first—cheers erupted, deafening and wild. Applause, screams of victory, and chants of his name.
 “Father Crow! Father Crow!”
But then—
The abyssal magic, hidden within the crown, activated.
A pulse—dark, silent, and unseen by the eye—spread like a wave across the courtyard, binding every crow below to the abyss. Not killing them… not yet. But marking them. Changing them. Controlling them.
The cheers turned to screams. Some collapsed. Some clutched their heads. A few fled in panic.
But most… stood still, stunned by the foreign power now woven into their very being.
Father Crow turned to the mutilated guard beside him and dropped him to the floor with a heavy thud. He handed him a black sack, tied with crimson cord.
“Seeing how you reacted to me… I’d wager you’re some kind of leader. Maybe even a general.”
He leaned in slightly.
“I want you and your people to make sure every single crow—every one of them—wears this mask. Including you.”
The guard looked inside the bag. Inside were dozens of black, abyss-marked crow masks—each cursed, each permanent.
“And if I don’t?” the guard spat, defiant even in pain.
Father Crow smiled, just a little.
“Then I take your other arm. And this time…”
 “You’ll feel five times the pain.”
The guard trembled, then lowered his head, resigned.
“…And where are you going, if I may ask… my lord?”
Father Crow turned toward the horizon. His voice was calm, distant.
“Oh… just a little family execution.”
Father Crow walked the old path to his former home,He made no attempt to hide himself.
He wanted them to see him coming.
And they did.
Word spread fast. The Hoga Rath clan—warriors to the core—armed themselves, feeling a familiar, suffocating fear in their bones.
That fear had a name.
And when they stepped outside, when they saw the figure standing in the yard of their ancestral grounds, tall and cloaked in darkness—
They froze.
The figure slowly reached up…
…and removed his mask.
Gabriel.
Older. Harder. Colder.
But unmistakably him.
Their long-banished disgrace had returned—no longer a boy, no longer an outcast.
A silence fell over the clan's courtyard. Then, rage broke it.
His mother, still as fierce and proud as ever, stepped forward, hate in her eyes.
“You dare come back here?”
His brothers, armored and snarling, drew their weapons without hesitation. One spat at the ground, the other cursed his name.
“We should’ve finished you when you were a freak with books!”
Blades were drawn, spears leveled.
But two did not move.
Jakob, his once-silent supporter, now stood speechless—his blade still sheathed, staring at the abyss his brother had become.
And beside him, their father, no longer the towering warrior he once was, but still a man of presence. His eyes, worn and tired, didn’t hold anger… only shock.
He spoke, voice cracked but steady.
“Gabriel… what have you become?”
Father Crow looked at his father—no smile, no hate.
Only the cold, quiet resolve of a man who had buried the child he once was.
“Exactly what you always wanted—”
His voice echoed through the courtyard like a verdict.
“A strong warrior. One powerful enough to kill a king.”
He took a slow step forward, halberd glinting with abyssal power.
“Now I’ll prove it.”
His gaze swept across the yard, locking eyes with each of them—his mother, his brothers, the warriors of his bloodline who once mocked his spells and kicked dust on his name.
“Let me show you—”
His voice dropped into a low growl.
“—how I alone… can kill all nine of you.”
The wind picked up. Shadows seemed to ripple unnaturally around him, coiling like serpents. The abyss stirred—hungry, eager to feed on what remained of the bloodline that had cast him out.
His brothers charged first, roaring with fury, blades raised.
But Father Crow didn’t flinch.
The courtyard erupted into chaos.
And the execution began.
The first brother lunged, roaring with a twin-axe strike aimed for Father Crow’s neck.
Without a word, Father Crow sidestepped, the halberd swinging in a crescent arc that cleaved through both axes—and his brother’s chest, sending him crashing to the ground in a spray of blood.
The second brother followed immediately, sword overhead in a downward slash.
Father Crow raised his halberd, catching the blade mid-air—then twisted, snapping the sword in half and driving his boot into the brother’s knee. As the bone shattered, the halberd came down, splitting his skull with ruthless precision.
Two down.
The third tried to flank him with a spear—smart, from a distance.
Father Crow spun the halberd like a cyclone, deflecting the spear with practiced ease. In one fluid motion, he caught the shaft mid-thrust, yanked the attacker forward, and drove the blade deep into the crow’s throat, twisting viciously before shoving him off.
Three down.
But then—movement behind him. Shadows shifting.
The family’s butlers, trained assassins, made a desperate attempt to strike from behind. Quick. Silent. Efficient.
But Gabriel saw it coming.
Without turning, he unleashed a wave of abyssal energy, a shockwave of black tendrils that ripped through them like paper. Limbs flew, screams choked on blood, and within seconds—all were dead.
No hesitation. No mercy.
His father, sword still gripped tightly, stood frozen—shocked.
Not just by the power.
By the cold precision.
By how the boy they abandoned had become a monster not even their war-hardened legacy could match.
“Gabriel…” his voice was low, grave. “Using magic isn’t what makes a warrior weak. It’s relying only on magic… That’s not why you were built.”
Gabriel—no, Father Crow—turned to him slowly.
His voice was calm, almost amused.
“Is that so?”
The shadows curled tighter around him, the abyss humming with restrained fury.
“Well then, Father…”
He lifted his hand, abyssal power crackling in his palm, raw and unstable.
“Allow me to show you what real magic looks like.”
With a thrust of his hand, he unleashed a wave of destructive energy, a wide arc of pure abyssal force—laced with fire, shadow, and soul-rending weight.
Jakob didn’t block it.
 Because Gabriel aimed around him—on purpose.
His mother and father, standing beside Jakob, raised their weapons and braced—blocking the blow, barely surviving as it slammed into them with the force of a crashing world.
The shockwave shattered the courtyard, breaking pillars, cracking stone.
Two of his younger brothers didn’t react in time. The blast hit them full-on—obliterating them instantly, their bodies reduced to ash and shadow.
From behind the smoke, one voice emerged.
Eldor—his oldest brother—staggered out, his armor cracked, his eyes burning with rage.
He had survived.
But only barely.
The rest of the butlers, those hiding in the shadows, were gone. Vaporized.
Gabriel lowered his hand.
Only Jakob, Eldor, and their parents remained.
The storm was nearly over.
Gabriel’s father stood firm despite the burns on his armor, the strain in his voice revealing the weight of his words.
His eyes, once full of pride and command, now brimmed with horror—and grief.
“Gabriel… the magic you’re using—it’s evil. It’s corrupted. It’s twisting you into something you're not.”
He raised his sword, trembling only slightly now.
“But it’s not too late. I’m going to save you from it… even if it means killing you.”
A long pause. Then, his voice softened.
“I just want you to know—no matter what happens, I always loved you.”
He turned his gaze to the last of his warriors.
“Honny, Eldor… let’s finish this.”
He looked to Jakob—still frozen in place.
“Jakob, snap out of this! That’s not your brother anymore. It’s a monster.”
His voice cracked.
“Either run far from here… or help us purify his poor soul.”
The courtyard fell still again.
Gabriel, face unreadable, stood tall—halberd pulsing with abyssal flame, his cloak still billowing in the ruinous wind he’d summoned.
Eldor stepped forward, sword in both hands, eyes locked on Gabriel with burning intensity.
His armor was scorched, his cloak torn, but his posture held the unmistakable strength of a seasoned warrior. He didn’t speak—he let his blade do the talking.
Their mother, blood running down her temple, took her place opposite him, daggers in hand once more.
Their father stood at the center, leading the charge, sword gleaming with a holy light he had never used before.
Together, they moved in unison
Just as Gabriel’s halberd was about to fall on his mother—
Three red bolts of energy blasted into his side, sending him skidding across the courtyard.
Jakob, fists trembling with power, stood in a defensive stance. His eyes were desperate—but determined.
Gabriel rose slowly, dust and smoke curling from his shoulders. He cracked his neck and exhaled.
“You know…” he said, voice chillingly calm, “there’s one more trick I’ve been saving.”
He snapped his fingers.
“Boys. Take care of Mother, Father, and Eldor. Don’t kill them… yet.”
From the blood-soaked ground, the bodies of his fallen brothers began to twitch—black tendrils of abyssal magic stitching them back together. One by one, they rose, eyes void of light, now mere vessels of Gabriel’s will.
The courtyard echoed with gasps and screams as the dead obeyed.
Gabriel stepped forward, slow and steady, his eyes fixed on Jakob.
Jakob took a step back.
“Please, Gabriel. Don’t do this. Don’t you think you’ve punished them enough?”
His voice cracked, pleading.
“This isn’t you. This isn’t the little brother I remember.”
Gabriel paused, face hardening.
“Jakob… you’re still just as foolish. Just as weak.”
He raised his hand, fingers twitching with power.
“You were too weak to protect me back then. And now… you’re too weak to fight me.”
His voice dropped cold.
“This isn’t punishment. It’s justice. It’s what they deserve.”
Jakob’s heart ached. Words weren’t reaching him—nothing was.
So he lunged.
Fists blazing with red energy, Jakob attacked in a flurry. Punch after punch aimed with rage and sorrow.
But Gabriel didn’t even flinch.
With one hand, he blocked, parried, and dismantled Jakob’s attacks effortlessly. Then, in one swift motion, he struck Jakob in the chest—a single, crushing blow that sent him crashing to the ground, unconscious.
Gabriel stood over him, eyes distant.
“See? I told you…”
He knelt down.
“You’re too afraid to kill me. And that’s what’s holding you back.”
He stood again and snapped his fingers. A swirling portal of black and green opened behind Jakob’s limp form.
“This portal will take you far from here. Somewhere safe… Somewhere you won’t have to watch what happens next.”
Gabriel looked down one final time.
“But if our paths cross again… don’t stand in my way. I don’t want to have to kill you.”
And with that, he kicked Jakob through the portal. It closed with a quiet hum behind him.
Silence returned to the ruined courtyard.
Gabriel turned his head toward the battlefield, where his resurrected brothers now surrounded his wounded parents and a battered Eldor.
Gabriel turned away from the fading shimmer of the portal, his boots crunching over broken stone and snow-stained blood. The air around him crackled with the lingering residue of abyssal power.
Before him stood the last three members of his family his father, still gripping his sword with both hands, breathing hard; his mother, bleeding and barely standing, but still defiant; and Eldor, the oldest, holding his blade steady, his pride now stripped down to raw fury.
Behind them, the reanimated brothers moved like puppets—soulless, silent, surrounding the trio like vultures waiting for the final twitch of life.
Gabriel raised his hand, and the undead brothers froze instantly—silent, soulless, obedient.
He turned his gaze back to the shattered remnants of his family, eyes settling on his bloodied mother, his shaken father, and a panting Eldor, still standing tall despite the gash across his armor.
Gabriel’s voice echoed through the broken courtyard—calm, collected, deadly.
“Now then…”
He took a step forward, halberd dragging across the stone, sparks trailing behind him.
“Let’s pick up from where we lef off"
He launched forward without warning.
Eldor met him, swords clashing in a violent storm of steel and fury. The air around them cracked with each impact—Eldor’s form fueled by sheer will, Gabriel’s movements driven by years of honed wrath and abyssal strength.
Eldor ducked a wide sweep, cut across Gabriel’s ribs again—more black blood.
But Gabriel didn’t slow.
He caught Eldor’s next swing mid-strike, twisting the sword from his grip and kneeing him in the stomach with brutal force, lifting him off the ground. Eldor collapsed, coughing blood—but still conscious.
Their father charged in, swinging his blade in a clean, righteous arc. Gabriel spun, blocking with the haft of the halberd, then grabbed his father’s arm mid-swing and unleashed a point-blank pulse of abyssal energy, sending the man flying into a cracked wall.
Gabriel turned toward his mother next. Despite her bruised and battered appearance, she still looked ready to fight. In fact, she charged at him without hesitation. At the same moment, his father used his super speed to strike from behind, while Eldor attacked from the front to support his mother. But Gabriel was prepared. With a surge of abyssal green aura, he released a shockwave that knocked back both Eldor and his father.
His mother braced herself, assuming the aura would hit her too and raised her daggers in a defensive stance. But Gabriel had tailored the aura’s force—only Eldor and his father were affected. Before his mother could react or lower her guard, Gabriel moved in with terrifying speed and sliced her and her twin daggers clean in half with his abyss-infused halberd.
Gabriel didn’t stop to look at her.
 He turned—the halberd still dripping—toward the last two.
Eldor and their father, both battered but still alive, rose from the rubble.
Eldor’s eyes were bloodshot, rage and sorrow blending into something wild and desperate. Their father, though older and slower, stood tall—gripping his blade like it was the only thing left keeping him upright.
Gabriel slowly approached.
Eldor charged first, roaring, blade flashing in wide, aggressive sweeps. Gabriel parried each strike with practiced ease—deflecting, redirecting, letting Eldor burn out his strength.
Their father appeared in a blur, trying to flank once more, blade slicing toward Gabriel’s spine.
But this time, Gabriel anticipated it.
With a backward twist of his halberd, he knocked the sword away mid-swing and slammed the pole end into his father's chest, sending him skidding backward.
Eldor, seizing the moment, landed a blow—cutting deep into Gabriel’s side.
Gabriel hissed but didn’t stumble.
Instead, he turned to Eldor with a look that froze the air around them.
“Not bad.”
Gabriel headbutted Eldor, then followed with a bone-crushing knee to the ribs, lifting him off his feet with the sheer force of it. Eldor gasped for air, stunned and broken.
Gabriel grabbed him by the throat, lifting him effortlessly, abyssal energy building in his other hand—ready to end it.
But just as he was about to strike—
Steel flashed.
With a cry of rage, their father struck, and in one swift, brutal move—sliced Gabriel’s arm severing it at the forearms.
Gabriel staggered back, his severed limb falling, blood pouring—black and steaming.
Their father stood tall, his aura now fully unleashed. Gone was the man who held back. What remained was a war-hardened monster, his blade burning with divine energy.
But Gabriel only looked down at his bleeding stumps, exhaled, and then smiled.
“If you wanted to save him…”
 “…you should’ve aimed to kill"
Before his father could react, Gabriel turned back to Eldor, his face expressionless—his fury razor-focused.
Though his hands had been severed, his arm still pulsed with abyssal energy. Eldor still hung by the throat, suspended in the air by Gabriel’s half-healed arm—barely conscious, his body broken and limp.
Gabriel didn’t hesitate.
From the forming stump of his hand, a beam of pure abyssal power burst forth—violent, raw, and point-blank into Eldor
The light swallowed him.
Eldor’s mouth opened in a scream, but no sound escaped. Only the glow.
Then—silence.
No blood. No remains.
Just ash and smoke, swirling away in the breeze.
Eldor was gone.
His father collapsed to his knees, the weight of it all breaking him at last.
Gabriel walked over slowly, his halberd trailing behind like a shadow.
He reached down, picking up his freshly regrown hand from the ground. Fitting it back in place with a sickening snap, he looked down at his father and spoke coldly:
“Don’t feel bad. There was nothing you could’ve done to save him.”
His father, face twisted with grief and rage, raised his sword and lunged again—faster, harder, unleashing everything.
But Gabriel had already adapted.
 Already evolved.
He met his father blow for blow, step for step—until he began pushing him back. Strike after strike, the air itself trembled around them. One parry. Two. A feint. A counter.
Then a lock.
Their weapons clashed—halberd against blade—face to face, close enough to hear each other’s breath.
In a single, fluid motion, Gabriel shifted his stance, broke the lock, and drove his halberd straight through his father's chest, the blade erupting from his back in a violent spray of blood and black light. His father’s sword slipped from his hand. No final words. No last breath. Just a stunned look of realization—this was always how it would end. Gabriel yanked the halberd free. His father dropped to his knees… then fell face-first into the dirt. Dead. The courtyard was silent now.  
Gabriel stood in the middle of the bloodstained courtyard, his halberd now resting quietly in the ground, its edge still glowing with the energy of lives it had ended.
He looked upon the shattered ruins of his household—the home that raised him in scorn, molded him in pain, and discarded him like a mistake.  
He raised a hand, and the abyss answered. Black tendrils surged from the earth, weaving and coiling, rebuilding the house stone by stone—not as it once was, but twisted, corrupted, a monument of torment. The walls pulsed like a living thing, whispers leaking through its cracks. Then Gabriel snapped his fingers once more. From the broken remains of his family—their bodies, bloodied and lifeless—he summoned their souls, binding them in chains of shadow and dragging them into the house. There, within its cursed halls, their spirits were trapped, forced to relive their worst memories, feel every wound, and endure an eternity of pain. An eternal prison, carved from vengeance and sorrow. To ensure it stood forever, Gabriel reanimated their corpses once more—twisted, hollow-eyed guardians—forced to guard their own tomb. Satisfied, Gabriel walked into the shadow of a nearby ridge, sat down beneath a dead tree, and rested. The house behind him echoed with screams—not just cries of pain, but of regret, shame, and madness. And as he closed his eyes, surrounded by the chilling chorus of suffering, Father Crow smiled. Gabriel sat beneath the dead tree, listening to the house behind him breathe and scream. The wind was cold, but to him it felt like nothing—just another part of the silence he now carried within. For a moment, he let the quiet wash over him. He had done what he came for. He had ended the chapter that made him. But then—his eyes opened. “Right… i was at the middle of somthing" He stood up, brushing dust from his armor. With a flick of his hand, he summoned his crow mask, placing it over his face once more. The moment it settled, he wasn’t Gabriel anymore. He was Father Crow again. His voice, his presence, his power—returned to its full weight. He turned his back on the house of suffering, now hidden in the forest behind layers of abyssal wards. A monument to the past, left to rot. As he walked down the hill toward the dark outline of the Crow Kingdom’s capital. 
A cold wind swept through the valley as Father Crow returned to the heart of the Crow Kingdom—the newly claimed capital.
The gates opened before him without resistance. The shadow he cast stretched long across the courtyard stones, and the whispers of power followed his every step.
He made his way to the royal balcony, the place once used by the king to address his people. Now, it belonged to Father Crow.
As he stepped out, he found the courtyard below filled with crows, each of them standing in silent formation, wearing their cursed black masks—except one. next to him stood the crow who had overseen the mask distribution.
He wasn't wearing one.
“Yes, my lord,” he said carefully. “But… when I saw others put on the mask, they screamed in pain—just for a moment—and then some of them… their eyes started to glow. Others didn’t.”
He took a breath.
“I wanted to understand exactly what the mask does before I put it on.”
Father Crow tilted his head—curious, not angry.
“And who are you to question me?”
The guard hesitated.
“If I tell you… will you kill me?”
Father Crow let out a dry chuckle, the wind stirring around his armor.
“No. I’m in a good mood. There’s no need for more blood today.”
The guard nodded and finally stepped forward.
“My name is Velterra. Probably the last surviving member of the Hoga Rath clan, And before you killed the king, I served him as his general.”
A flicker of surprise passed through Father Crow’s eyes—but only for a second.
“Interesting.”
He smiled beneath his mask.
“Oh, you worry too much. I didn’t kill the entire Hoga Rath clan. Just the part that needed to die.”
He gestured to the crowd gathering below.
“As for what the mask does… you’re about to hear.”
Father Crow stepped forward to the edge of the balcony, his abyssal voice booming across the castle grounds like a curse carved into the wind—commanding, echoing, inescapable.

“Crows of the Kingdom!
Thank you for gathering.”

His eyes swept across the masked crowd below.

“By now, most of you have learned two important truths:

One—if you try to take off the mask… you die. So don’t.

Two—some of your eyes glow, and some do not.”

He paused, letting the tension grow.

“Those with glowing eyes… you are free to leave.”

There was a ripple of movement as the glowing-eyed Crows silently turned and began to walk away, fading into the shadows.

Once the last of them was gone, Father Crow’s tone shifted—lower, colder.

“Now then… those of you who stayed…”

He looked down at them with quiet disappointment.

“The reason your eyes don’t glow is simple—you’re weaker than I expected.”

The air tensed.

“But don’t worry. I can fix that.”

A faint grin curled at the corner of his mouth.

“You’ll be thrown into the army.
Through time, battle, and suffering…
you’ll either grow stronger—

—or die.”

He turned away, already finished with them.

“Good luck out there.”

A beat of silence.

“Dismissed.”

Father Crow turned to Velterra, eyes glowing faintly behind the mask.
“So then… will you now be so kind as to put a mask on?”
Velterra didn’t flinch.
“Unfortunately… no. In fact, this whole speech just made me want to wear one even less.”
He stepped closer, his one remaining arm resting at his side, the sleeve of the other neatly pinned.
“But… for sparing my life—and out of respect for what you’ve become—I’ll offer you something better.”
His tone grew sharper.
“For as long as my real arm is gone, I’ll obey every order you give—no matter how brutal, stupid, or suicidal it might be.”
The wind held its breath.
Father Crow blinked, momentarily caught off guard by the blunt honesty. But slowly… a grin curled beneath his mask.
“Hah… now that is a deal I can appreciate.”
He stepped beside Velterra and extended a hand toward the courtyard, gesturing to the mass of masked crows below—the ones whose eyes did not glow.
“Then here is your first task, General.”
His voice dropped into a low, commanding hum.
“See those weaklings down there? you are now thier commander"
Velterra’s eyes widened slightly.
“You want me to train them?”
“yes,” Father Crow said.
“But I want you to protect this kingdom and everyone in it using only them. No elite forces. No glowing eyes. No second chances.”
He leaned in slightly.
“Consider it your punishment… and your test.”
Velterra, after a long pause, let out a single, sharp breath through his nose—half a laugh, half a sigh.
“Understood, my lord.”
And for the first time, he saluted.
Not to a king. Not to a tyrant.
To Father Crow.
The blade embedded itself in the stone just inches from Father Crow’s head, the force of it cracking the floor where it landed.
Even he hadn’t seen it coming.
Not because he couldn’t react—but because the one who threw it hadn’t meant to kill him.
Father Crow’s eyes narrowed. He turned toward the throne.
There, reclining with an air of furious judgment, sat Osricain, arms crossed, his expression burning with disappointment and rage.
“What the hell do you think you’re doing?”
His voice echoed like thunder in the vast throne room.
“First, you kill the top elite warriors—which, fine, they were your family and honestly, they sucked, so I’ll let that slide.”
He stood, pacing toward Gabriel with barely restrained fury.
“But then you assign the weakest crows to defend the kingdom? And hand leadership to a half-crippled general?”
He gestured wildly, voice rising.
“How do you think you’re going to deal with the other Overlords when they attack? You think they’ll play fair? You think they’ll give you time to build character through your army's suffering?”
“We had a deal—you were going to lead this kingdom. Not ruin it with poetic vengeance and half-baked theatrics.”
Father Crow’s cloak shifted, the air around him deathly still.
He didn’t speak at first.
Then, calmly—dangerously—he stepped forward, his voice low and even: Then he spoke, voice cold and precise:

“First of all… you told me I could do what I want. And now, suddenly, you’ve changed your mind?”

He continued walking—each step deliberate, boots echoing off stone.

“Second… how do you know all of that?
It just happened.
And I didn’t see you in any of those events.”

He stopped halfway between them.

“Thirdly… once the weak die, the strong become easier to control.
Fear breeds obedience.
Loss breeds loyalty.
I’m not breaking the kingdom, Osricain. I’m purging the noise.
You want elite? I’ll give you real elite—born from blood, not titles.”
He took one last step, now face to face with him.

“And fourth… I’ve made allies during the last thirty years.
Ones you don’t even know exist.
They’ll give us the protection we need—until this kingdom is remade.”

He let that sink in.
And then, with a cold smile:

“And lastly…”

He leaned forward slightly, voicelike frost on steel.

“What are Overlords… exactly?”

Osricain sighed, dragging a hand down his face before slamming his fist against his forehead in frustration.

“First—
You goddamn idiot—we’re Crows.
We can summon Ishkrow—the crow creatures.
Usually we use them to communicate across great distances…
But me? I use them to spy.”

He pointed a sharp finger.

“So yes, I was watching.
Second… fair point. I did say you could do whatever you wanted. That’s on me.
But lastly—let me make something clear…”

He crossed his arms again, his voice low, sharp, and grim.

“Overlords are stupidly strong.
Some of them are even more powerful than you.
Sure—they’re not as fast or as physically overwhelming as the Gargantura…
But their magical abilities?”
He shook his head.
“Terrifying.”

He stepped forward again.

“They’re like Warlords—territory-obsessed maniacs—but unlike Warlords, they’re disciplined.
Warlords attack for chaos.
Overlords attack with purpose.”

A pause.

Osricain’s expression softened just slightly.

“At least you had the sense to keep Velterra alive.
That gives us a chance.”

Father Crow raised an eyebrow, slightly amused.

“You said he was useless with one arm.”

Osricain scoffed.

“I was being dramatic.
Caught up in the moment.”

He rolled his eyes, folding his arms tighter.

“Velterra is more capable than you give him credit for.
You got lucky taking his arm before he realized how dangerous you were.
If he’d gone all out from the start…
You might not be standing here.”

Another step. Now face to face.

“So tell me…
Where are those allies you spoke of?
Because they better arrive before the Overlords realize the King is dead.
Once they know the throne is unguarded, they’ll descend like vultures.”

Father Crow said nothing.

Not for a long moment.
Then, slowly, Father Crow raised his hand…

SNAP.

A sharp echo filled the throne room.

Immediately, the torches lining the walls flickered violently, and a sudden rush of cold air swept through the chamber. The shadows twisted, stretching unnaturally—warping like ink in water.

From those shadows…
they appeared.

One by one.

Stepping through cracks in space like phantoms escaping the abyss, they emerged—figures cloaked in darkness, each one wrapped in a black-feathered aura.
Some walked on limbs that bent the wrong way. Others glided. Some oozed through rifts in the air, their forms barely stable.
All of them wore crow masks, some ancient and cracked, others smooth and new.

They stood silently behind Father Crow like a funeral procession of nightmares.

Osricain’s eyes narrowed.

He recognized a few—and that alone sent a shiver down his spine.

“You brought back them?” he muttered.

These were not just warriors.
They were abominations of history.
Banished generals.
Forbidden spells turned flesh.
Creatures from dead dimensions.

Osricain let out a tired sigh, one hand on his hip.

“This… is what I have to work with?”

Father Crow tilted his head.

“Are you underestimating them?”
“I thought you learned something from the former king and Velterra…
—not to judge a creature by its appearance.”

Osricain didn’t flinch.

“I judged them by their aura, not their looks.
But… again, you're right.”
He looked over the terrifying group, and let out a long breath.
“Perhaps I should just… wait and see.”

Father Crow smirked
"oh you will"

And then, a week later—he felt it.

A presence.

Above.

He looked up from the training yard, eyes narrowing against the harsh sunlight.

A witch.

Cloaked in deep purple, she drifted in slow, deliberate circles above the palace—perched atop a floating staff that pulsed with silent, eerie grace. Her robes rippled like flame in a storm, trailing smoke and embers that vanished before they touched the ground. Her presence was impossible to ignore.

Archers scrambled into formation, loosing volleys of arrows.

They missed.

She moved like wind through water—effortless, fluid, untouchable.

Father Crow’s hand snapped out. One of his guards flinched as his spear was ripped from his grip by unseen force.

With deadly precision, Father Crow hurled the spear skyward.

A streak of steel cut through the sky.

Direct hit.

The witch jerked violently, spinning out of control, and crashed in a spiraling descent—slamming into the earth with a burst of snow, stone, and splintered wood.

Silence.

Then—

A wave of raw, wild energy exploded from the crater, shaking the palace walls and knocking men off their feet.

From the broken earth, she rose.

One hand pressed into the ground. Her hair whipped wildly around her glowing eyes, alive with violet magic. The dust parted around her like mist fleeing fire.

She wasn’t running.

She wasn’t wounded.

She was ready.

A wicked grin spread across her face as she slid into a low, sharp stance—her robes igniting in violet flame that danced with unstable magic.

“So… you’re the one they call Father Crow,” she said, her voice sharp, playful, and far too confident. “I’m Vel—”

She never finished.

Father Crow lunged.

In a flash of black-green light, his halberd sliced through the air in a deadly arc aimed to silence her name before it could be spoken.

But she twisted—unnaturally, impossibly—spinning mid-air, the blade missing her face by inches.

She landed with a light step, boots tapping against the cracked earth.

“Damn. You’re not friendly at all, are you?” she grinned, sparks dancing in her hair.
“This is going to be fun.”

The battle erupted.
Father Crow moved like a shadow—his halberd sweeping, spinning, pulsing with abyssal energy. Velmora countered with blazing arcs of raw magic, teleportation bursts, and dancing flames that twisted like living serpents.
Even with a few of his masked allies leaping in to assist, he struggled.
Her spells didn’t just burn—they undid magic, unraveling the abyss around her with a strange, ancient energy. Every time he thought he had an opening, she warped out of reach, taunting him with a wicked smirk.
Then, she feinted a strike, vanished, and reappeared behind him, a glowing dagger of condensed magic at his throat.
“Gotcha—”
“Velmora, what the hell are you doing here?!” came Osricain’s voice, slicing through the chaos.
She paused, the blade flickering out of her hand.
“Oh—oops,” she said, turning casually. “I got caught up in the moment.”
She floated back lazily, her staff appearing beside her.
“Osricain! How have you been? It’s been, what… two thousand years?”
Osricain narrowed his eyes.
“Still reckless as ever.”
“Oh, hush,” she winked. “I just came to say hi… and see how powerful the new ruler of the crows is.”
She turned to Father Crow, eyes gleaming.
“Gotta say—I’m very impressed. A little stiff, but you hit hard.”
She brushed dust from her robes.
“Don’t worry—I’ll let the other Overlords know this kingdom is already claimed.”
She turned, as if nothing had happened.
“Well. I’ll be leaving now.”
But Father Crow’s voice boomed, furious.
“If you don’t kill me now… I’ll hunt you later.”
Velmora smirked, unbothered.
“We’ll see about that.”
She gave a mock salute, her voice soft and dripping with mischief.
“It was fun, Father Crow. Can’t wait to meet you again.”
And with a snap of her fingers, she vanished in a swirl of glittering crimson light.
Silence returned.
Father Crow stood still, his halberd humming with rage, magic crackling along its edge.
Osricain stepped beside him.
“That… was an Overlord.”
Osricain exhaled, still staring at the place where Velmora had vanished.
“She’s the most powerful Overlord of them all.”
He spoke slowly, like the weight of the truth was still settling into the room.
“Out of all the witches, she’s the only one who can use every school of magic. Elemental, arcane, abyssal, soul, time—even forbidden magic no one else dares touch.”
He looked to Father Crow.
“Beating her wouldn’t be easy. Not for anyone.”
Father Crow stood quietly for a moment, cloak brushing the broken stone beneath his feet.
“So then,” he said, “out of all the Overlords… where would you rank me?”
Osricain raised a brow, lips tightening with thought.
“Tenth,” he said bluntly. “You’re probably one of the top ten strongest Overlords right now.”
Crow’s eyes narrowed.
“And how many are there?”
“Last I knew,” Osricain said, “thirty-three. If none of them died in the last two thousand years, then that number should still be accurate.”
Father Crow’s grip tightened on his halberd. His voice dropped low, a grin curling at the edge of his mouth.
“Good.”
“Because if they’re all half as strong as Velmora—or stronger—then this won’t be boring.”
He turned toward the balcony again, looking out at his kingdom—his broken, reshaped kingdom—where the masks ruled, the abyss flowed, and loyalty was carved through strength and fear.
“It’s time to expand. To grow stronger.”
He raised a hand slowly, fingers twitching with purpose.
“I will make this kingdom greater than it has ever been.”
And for the first time in a long, long while—
Father Crow smiled.
Over the years, Father Crow rose through the ranks by killing several overlords, though the cost was high—he lost some of his best generals. To prevent future losses, he imposed a strict rule: no general may use more than 75% of their power unless he permits it. If a crow couldn’t win with that, they weren’t worthy of the title.
Father Crow’s cruelty had already drawn the eyes of gods and overlords alike. His conquest, his abyss-forged kingdom, his masked legions—they whispered of tyranny and power.
ChatGPT said:
But one act… cut through the silence like a scream.

Far beyond the mainland, on a lonely island hidden by ancient protections, Father Crow found a warrior—one strong enough to turn tides.

When asked to join, the warrior refused.

But instead of killing him, Father Crow chose a different punishment.

He wiped out the island.

Every bird. Every beast. Every soul.

Except one.

The warrior was left alive—alone, untouched, unreachable.

To seal this prison of solitude, Father Crow placed Annabelle as warden. A ghost in the ruins. Always watching. Always ensuring the warrior stayed isolated… and alive.

For fifty years, the warrior endured silence. No death. No escape. No voices but the sea.

And then—he broke.

He joined Father Crow.
That single act of psychological warfare stunned the world.
Even Overlords and gods who had ignored Father Crow’s rise now turned their attention to him. Assassins came, Strike teams followed, death wishes, All failed.
Eventually, a diplomatic Overlord named Bell came to Father Crow with an offer.
He came not with threats, but with words—seeking to convince Father Crow to join the Overlord Agreement, a fragile pact created to prevent all-out war between overlords and and to preserve what little peace remained. 
Father Crow was almost convinced—until he saw Velmora among the delegation.
He refused instantly.
That’s when it happened.
The earth cracked beneath their feet, cutting off all the Overlords.
From the rupture stepped Charly, the champagne demon. dressed in charm and chaos.
who insist that the deal must happen With a snap of his fingers, each Overlord received a paper—the deal adjusted just slightly to suit their egos, their paranoia, their desires.
Father Crow was skeptical… until Charly summoned a bottle of wine into his hands.
He took a sip.
And despite crows being resistant to all poison, the drink made him feel…
Funny. Powerful. Light.
 Good.
He smiled—just slightly—and signed.
The Overlord Ring was formed.
One quiet day, deep in one of Charly’s sacred bars—a great tree hollowed into a tavern—Father Crow sat, mildly drunk, annoyed by assassins who had already tried (and failed) to kill him during his off hours.
That’s when a warrior named Willow entered.
She didn’t want to conquer. Didn’t want to kill.
She simply wanted to test his strength.
At first, Father Crow ignored her.
But then… she hit him.
Hard.
He didn’t stagger—but he sobered.
His aura flared. The abyss roared. He rose, eyes sharp, and engaged her fully.
The fight erupted.
Blades clashed. Magic sparked. Furniture was destroyed.
And then—he accidentally hit the tree itself.
The bar began to sink into the ground, bark cracking, roots withdrawing.
Both he and Willow were caught off guard as the world shook beneath them.
The bartender, who had watched in silence, raised a hand and waved gently.
“Father Crow… I’m very sorry. But Charly has banned you from all his bars.”
“You destroyed this place. You know the rule—kill, but don’t destroy. It was a pleasure serving you.”
The tree continued to vanish.
Father Crow’s voice boomed with rage.
“Let this tree fall, and I’ll kill you.”
The bartender only smiled.
“I might be a bartender, but I’m also Charly’s messenger.”
“You sure you want to kill me?”
Father Crow hesitated.
But it was already too late.
The tree vanished beneath the earth.
And so did Willow.
The ground trembled as Father Crow let his rage loose.
Abyssal energy exploded from his body in all directions, pulverizing stone, collapsing trees, and shattering mountainside structures. Entire forests nearby wilted and died in seconds. Nothing within miles remained untouched.
And still, it wasn’t enough to calm the storm inside him.
He returned to his castle, his cloak trailing embers of shadow, and immediately summoned his assassins to find and kill willow. but with no luck.
one day, as he stood atop his throne room balcony—
Charly’s messenger appeared again.
Same neutral face. Same casual cheer.
“So… good news!”
The figure clapped their hands together softly.
“Turns out we made way too many crow-specific drinks. Charly’s decided he’ll sell them—only to you, of course—if you want to drink again.”
Father Crow stared.
“How much?”
The messenger grinned.
“Just 1,000 monster souls… or 500 human ones.”
Father Crow raised an eyebrow beneath his mask.
“Why fewer humans?”
“i dont know,” the messenger shrugged. “To me, human and monster souls taste the same. But Charly says human souls are ‘more flexible.’”
They made air quotes as if quoting a menu item.
“Whatever that means.”
Father Crow let out a long, tired sigh.
“Fine. I’ll pay you the souls.”
The messenger beamed like a merchant closing a deal.
“Oh, goody! Because you’re still banned, you won’t get them in the bars.”
They held out a small, intricately crafted black bell with abyssal markings and a crow feather tied to the handle.
“Ring this when you’ve got the payment. I’ll come to you. Delivery only.”
Then they bowed mockingly.
“Bye-bye~!”
They vanished in a puff of crimson smoke.
Father Crow had a problem—he needed souls. More than his world could offer.

Then he remembered: his magic could tear open portals to other universes.

Without delay, he dispatched his generals into new worlds to harvest what he required. While they hunted, Father Crow took a rare moment for himself. A quiet stroll through a distant forest.
While passing through a forest cloaked in mist and silence, he encountered Oboo—the god of knowledge.

Something felt off. Dangerous.

Sensing the threat, Father Crow didn’t wait.

He struck first.

His halberd cleaved the air, abyssal energy roaring behind it—but Oboo blocked the blow with unnatural ease, reading the attack as if it had already happened.

Their battle ignited the land.

Father Crow’s brute strength and abyssal fury clashed against Oboo’s twin daggers, but what made the god terrifying wasn’t just skill—it was foresight.

Oboo could see into the future.

Every strike Father Crow threw was met with precise counters. Every feint, anticipated. Every shift in rhythm, effortlessly adapted to.

The fight dragged on—vicious, unrelenting.

Abyssal winds screamed with every swing of Father Crow’s halberd, yet Oboo flowed like water around them, never faltering, always one step ahead.

It didn’t make sense.

No matter how chaotic, how unpredictable his moves were—Oboo moved like he had already fought this battle a thousand times.

Then, in a blur of motion—a feint, a sweep—Father Crow caught it.

Oboo dodged before he committed to the strike.

That’s when it clicked.

He wasn’t just fast.
He was seeing the future.

With that revelation, Father Crow shifted.

If prophecy guided Oboo, then he would overwhelm it.

He unleashed a new onslaught—not just fast or powerful, but devastating.

Abyssal spells tore open the ground.

Blades of void screamed through the air, cutting across dimensions.

Shockwaves cracked the sky.

These weren’t attacks meant to be dodged.

They were meant to end the fight.

ChatGPT said:
But each attack cost him.

Every movement drained more from his reserves. The abyss responded, but even it demanded a toll. With each passing moment, Father Crow pushed closer to his limits.

He had no choice.

This battle had to end—and soon.

Because the longer it lasted, the more the god of knowledge adapted.

Just when Father Crow thought he was gaining ground against Oboo’s foresight, the air shifted.

A new presence entered the fray.

The Dark Guardian stepped from the shadows—silent, towering, relentless.

Now it was two against one.

The battle doubled in intensity.
Precision met power.
Foresight met fury.

Father Crow’s abyssal energy lashed in every direction, carving trenches into the forest, shattering trees—but exhaustion clawed at him. His cloak was shredded, breath ragged, the abyss within him straining, boiling.

He knew he couldn’t win a battle of endurance.

So he changed tactics.

No more blind aggression.

He moved with restraint—dodging, watching, letting them come to him. A style he loathed—defensive, evasive, patient. But it was the only way.

Then he saw it.

A scar.
Faint, but deep.
On the Dark Guardian’s left side.

Old. Vulnerable.

It wasn’t much. But it was something.

The challenge was reaching it.

Oboo left no openings—his foresight, his positioning, his blades—it was impossible to slip past.

So Father Crow did the unthinkable.

He gathered his last reserves and unleashed a massive abyssal blast—not to kill, but to distract.

The ground split. Shadows screamed. The blast struck Oboo head-on, knocking him back.

Thirty seconds.

That was all he bought.

It was enough.

Father Crow lunged, halberd roaring with void, and drove it into the scar.

Steel met weakness.
Abyss met flesh.
The Dark Guardian staggered, then crumbled, the light fading from his form.

Silence.

Then—

Oboo rose.

But something was different.

The calm mind of a god was gone.

Only rage remained.

His expression twisted, his eyes burning with fury. His movements lost their perfect timing—foresight blurred by emotion.

And in that chaos… Father Crow found his chance.

Strike by strike, he turned the tide.

And just as he prepared the final blow—

Oboo vanished.
Father Crow stood among the wreckage. Breathless. Bloodied. Victorious?
Perhaps.
The Dark Guardian lay still.
Oboo—disappeared.
But in Father Crow’s mind, one truth echoed:
A god of knowledge and a shadow of old power had faced him—and retreated.
Whatever came next, the world would know:
Father Crow didn’t just survive gods.
He defied them.
After the brutal battle, Father Crow collapsed beside the smoldering ruin of what once was a battleground between gods. Snowflakes drifted down like ashes. He laid in silence, halberd buried beside him, eyes half-closed as the abyss within him finally grew still.
For the first time in ages… he rested.
Hours passed.
Maybe more.
And then—a flash of light.
Blinding. Divine. Ancient.
When it faded, the battlefield was empty. No crows. No halberd. No warrior. Just a small figure… swaddled in black feathers, crying softly in the snow.
Father Crow—reborn.
A baby.
His abyssal power? Gone.
 His memories? Erased.
 His past? Nothing but dust on the wind.
Hovering above him was a figure draped in flowing scrolls and silver ink. A god whose eyes shimmered with infinite knowledge—Shiashlian, another god of knowledge  Unlike Oboo, Shiashlian believed in compassion, in redemption… in rewriting what was broken.
And Father Crow was broken.
Shiashlian looked down at the infant with somber curiosity, then reached into the void and pulled a face from memory—Gabriel’s father.
The illusion settled over him like armor, and with a soft whisper of ancient language, Shiashlian cloaked them both in secrecy.
He took the baby in his arms and vanished into the falling snow, traveling to a remote shack hidden deep within the frozen north.
There, far from gods and overlords, wars and vengeance, the god of knowledge—wearing the mask of a father—began a new experiment:
To raise the former terror of the world not as a monster, but as a man.
 To forge kindness from ash.
 To see if evil… could be unlearned.
For 16,000 years, Shiashlian raised Father Crow in secret—hidden from gods, monsters, and time itself. Using divine restraint, Shiashlian never let him age past his late teens, hoping to keep the fire of rebellion small, manageable. In that small shack buried in eternal snow, the former conqueror became a humble son.
Or so it seemed.
Then, one day, while out foraging, the boy—Gabriel—stumbled across a frozen lake. The snow was thick. The air was still. But something in the shape of the ice, the slope of the hills, struck him like lightning.
This lake.
He knew it.
 Not from this life.
 From another.
The lake where he first touched the abyss.
And in that instant, the memories returned—like a flood, violent and absolute. He remembered everything. His power. His pain. His rise. His family. His kingdom. His rage.
The storm that had been buried for millennia ignited once more.
He walked back to the shack, aura shifting with every step—no longer the obedient son, but the shadow king reborn.
Shiashlian felt it instantly. That familiar, suffocating presence. But he didn’t understand how.
The door creaked open.
"Hello, Dad," Father Crow said with a malicious grin.

Shiashlian froze. That voice—impossible, familiar, wrong.

His eyes widened as he felt the shift.
The spell was broken.

He stood up fast, grabbing his staff, heart pounding.

"I may not be as strong as Oboo," Shiashlian said, backing away cautiously, "but in your current state… even I can defeat you."

Father Crow raised a hand and summoned his halberd—
But his teenage frame buckled under its weight. The weapon dipped, too heavy, too slow.

Shiashlian chuckled.

"Do not underestimate me," Father Crow snapped, eyes flaring with abyssal glow.

Then, without pause, he dismissed the halberd… and summoned his rapier.

A thin, wicked blade of green-black abyssal steel.

"And as thanks for not killing me all those years ago," he added coldly, "I'll make your death quick."

Then he moved.

Faster than Shiashlian could react.

Faster than thought.

And just as promised—
Father Crow killed him in a single, clean strike.
As Shiashlian’s body crumpled, Father Crow felt something shift within him. Two new powers awakened:
 – The ability to change his age at will.
 – And the ability to alter his appearance, taking on the face of anyone he chose.
But as the haze of battle faded, a thought lingered: Oboo… might still be alive.
 After all, killing him should have granted another power—but it hadn’t.
Still, that mystery could wait.
For now, he needed to return to his castle.
As he stepped out of the shack, a ripple in space twisted ahead of him. A figure emerged—a woman cloaked in purple mist, wielding a curved black scythe.
“Hello, Father Crow,” she said calmly. “I’m Zila—the witch goddess of the undead. But I’m not here for Shiashlian. I’m here… for you.”
Father Crow narrowed his eyes.
“I knew both of them would fail,” Zila continued. “but i made a promise. If Shiashlian died, I would stop you for him.”
Before he could react, she snapped her fingers.
Chains of glowing violet erupted from the ground, wrapping around Father Crow’s limbs and throat. He struggled—but they moved faster than even he could. His strength couldn’t break them.
“You see, killing isn’t really my thing, darling,” Zila said, winking.
A portal opened beneath his feet—blazing red, glowing with judgment.
“Enjoy hell.”
Gabriel screamed, not in pain, but in fury, as he was dragged into the abyss below—down, down, into Hell’s Court, where divine judgment awaited.
Zila watched the portal close.
Father Crow screamed, “You bitch!” as he was dragged into the abyss—down, down, spiraling into the black void of Hell’s Court, where divine judgment awaited.
Chains pulled him through twisted caverns and rivers of fire, until he was slammed into the center of a vast courtroom carved from obsidian and bone. Demons and demon gods gathered in rows, their glowing eyes fixed on him, their whispers thick with anticipation.
At the head of the court, the Devil himself stood, draped in a regal cloak of flame and shadow.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” the Devil began, voice booming through the chamber, “we are gathered to judge the actions of the accused—Father Crow—for a multitude of crimes across the verse, including—”
“Do I get any say in this?” Father Crow interrupted coldly, still bound in chains. “Or is there anything I can say that would actually change my fate?”
The Devil looked annoyed. “No—”
“Then just give me the punishment,” Father Crow snapped. “Let’s not waste everyone’s time.”
From the crowd, Charly’s voice echoed with amusement. “He has a point.”
The Devil sighed, visibly irritated. “Fine. Father Crow, your sentence is this: you are to know defeat—repeatedly and endlessly. You will face creatures stronger than you, one after another. Each one will kill you. Again, and again" He snapped his fingers.
In a blink, Father Crow was gone—cast into a cursed realm where colossal beasts, god-slaying warriors, and unspeakable horrors awaited him. One by one, they tore him down. Over and over. He died. Reformed. Fought again. Lost again.
After 300 brutal deaths, the Devil appeared before him once more—smiling like a man who enjoyed watching hope unravel.
“Well, how have you been?” he said, voice mockingly warm. “It’s been so long.”
Father Crow, beaten, bloodied, and barely standing, spat back: “Fuck you.”
The Devil chuckled. “Thought so. Anyway, I’m here to make a deal.”
Father Crow rolled his eyes. “Just get to the point. I’d rather die again than sit through another one of your speeches.”
The Devil sighed. “Fine. Most of my demon gods have died. and they retruned but they are Weak. Foolish. Unworthy. I want you—and your army—to fight them.”
Father Crow frowned. “Does my army still exist?"
The Devil nodded. “Oh, right. You’ve been away. Shiashlian replaced you with a human who carried your aura—well enough to fool even your closest commanders. Even after his death, the illusion held. Your empire still stands… and it’s one of the strongest in the world. You have a real chance.”
Father Crow stared for a long moment, letting the weight of it all sink in.
 “So why me?”
“Because the other overlords who could’ve done it… refused,” the Devil replied flatly.
“I see.” A slow smirk pulled at the corner of Father Crow’s lips.
 “So… does this mean I get to beat the shit out of Charly?”
The Devil didn’t hesitate. “Yes.”
That was all he needed.
The grin on Father Crow’s battered face widened. “Then let’s do it.”
He drew in a slow breath and straightened his posture, his broken body already starting to regenerate.
“How much time do I have to prepare?”
“Two months,” the Devil answered. Then, with a snap of his fingers—
—everything changed.
In an instant, Father Crow stood once more at the gates of his castle, staring up at the towering black spires. The cold wind blew against his cloak, carrying with it the scent of ash, steel, and blood.
The familiar weight of his domain settled around him.
His empire… awaited.
As Father Crow stepped through the towering black gates of his castle, a few of his generals surged forward, weapons drawn, mistaking him for an intruder. He didn’t even flinch. One gaze from his abyssal eyes was enough to freeze them in place.
But the true surprise came when he entered the throne room.
There, gathered before him, were his top generals—and as one, they bowed.
Father Crow paused.
“...How did you know?”
One of his top five generals, the sharp-eyed Kalvis, rose first. His voice was calm, respectful, and sure.
“Most of us aren’t idiots, my lord.
 Your aura is unique. No one else commands it. No one else could ever mimic it.
 And second…” he allowed a small smirk, “only you could fight off those idiots and not even break a sweat.”
He straightened her posture, hands behind her back.
“Honestly, it’s a miracle the human who replaced you fooled anyone for this long. Despite knowing that he was a human we kept the kingdom strong. And stronger still, waiting for your return.”
Father Crow nodded slowly, a dark satisfaction in his eyes. But then, his gaze shifted to the nervous human sitting awkwardly on the throne—his throne.
The man looked like a deer caught in a storm of abyss.
“You have nothing to worry about, human,” Father Crow said with a faint grin.
 “I’m not going to kill you.”
He raised a hand and snapped his fingers. In an instant, his own true form returned—tall, cloaked in abyssal power, his shadow spilling across the stone floor like smoke. The human’s form shimmered and shifted—becoming more human, more mundane.
“You’ve done well.
 You fooled an empire, kept it from crumbling.
 That takes wit.
 You may join our ranks.”
The man’s face lit up with relief and joy. He leapt to his feet.
“Oh my gods—thank you, my lord!
 Being a human again feels amazing.
 I—I’m Caleb. I’ve heard so many stories about you.
 Honestly, I was sure you’d kill me the moment we met. What a relief!”
Father Crow chuckled, just a little—then turned toward his generals.
“So… in two months, we’re going to be attacked by the demon gods.”
A hushed tension fell over the room—until Caleb suddenly blurted out:
“Holy shit!”
Father Crow ignored him and continued, calm and direct:
“But if you follow my plan, we should be able to win this.”
Caleb piped up again, bouncing slightly on his heels:
“Oh! Oh! What’s my part in the plan?”
Father Crow looked at him, brow slightly furrowed.
“...Are you okay?”
Kaida answered dryly without missing a beat:
“Don’t mind him, my lord.
 Probably a side effect of the relief—no longer needing to pretend he’s you… or that he’s not a human.”
Father Crow nodded in understanding.
“Ah. I see.
 Caleb—go do what you want for now. In one month, I’ll tell you your part.”
Caleb grinned, gave an awkward bow, and skipped out of the room. The remaining generals watched in disbelief.
One of them muttered:
“So… you learned empathy while you were gone?”
Father Crow paused.
“Hmm… I suppose I did.”
Another general raised a brow.
“And how do you even know about this attack?”
Father Crow replied coolly:
“Because I made a deal with the Devil himself—
 If we win, he sets me free.”
Two more generals snapped forward in protest.
“This is insane! Do you know how powerful the demon gods are?”
“You’re risking all our lives for this?!”
Father Crow’s patience snapped.
He snapped his fingers—and both generals collapsed, clutching their heads in agony as an unbearable pain surged through their minds.
“I don’t recall asking for your opinion,” Father Crow said coldly, his voice echoing through the throne room.
 “Now… shall we continue?”
The rest of the room fell into grim, obedient silence.
Father Crow stood at the center of the throne room, his voice booming with command:
“Gather every single general.
 Every single soldier.
 From every realm.
 I want them all here.”
A ripple of tension passed through the gathered commanders. One of the older generals stepped forward, concern in his voice:
“My lord… if we pull every force to the capital, we might lose territory. Entire realms could fall while we’re gathered here.”
Father Crow didn’t even blink.
“I don’t care,” he said coldly.
 “If we lose ground, we’ll conquer it again.
 And this time, we’ll crush it harder.”
No one dared to speak after that. Orders were given. Portals opened. The drums of war began to beat louder.
A month passed.
Father Crow had spent every moment of it rebuilding his strength, tracking down his commanders, and summoning his army back from the corners of the world. When the call came, even the traitor generals returned—among them, Koronis and Byleistr.
Their appearance shocked many… but what followed was even more unexpected.

A new ally arrived: the demon lord Gaster Stone.

He met Father Crow in the war room, where abyssal flames cast long shadows over towering maps and glowing sigils.

Father Crow studied him. “What’s your reason for joining me?”

Gaster shrugged, relaxed but unreadable. “I’m here to support Koronis and Byleistr. They serve under me now. I’d rather make sure they survive this war—and that you don’t backstab them.”

He grinned. “Also… I’ve always wanted to meet you in person.”

Father Crow raised an eyebrow, then gave a sharp smirk.

“Loyalty… rare in your kind.”

“Teaming up with you is rare among any kind,” Gaster replied.
Without another word, Gaster laid out everything he knew about the demon gods—battle tactics, strongholds, weaknesses.

With this trove of intelligence, Father Crow began reshaping his army. He split his forces into elite units, each one trained and armed to take down a specific demon god.

In his judgment, three posed the greatest threat: Blood, Magorath, and Belphegor.

They would be the first to fall.

Kaida and Caleb led the first wave of the assault.
As Father Crow anticipated, two demon gods—Beelzebub and Belphegor—charged forward to meet them.
Kaida didn’t hesitate. Her body glowed with layered enchantments as she raised both hands and unleashed a colossal blast of her magic.
The explosion struck both gods directly.
Beelzebub and Belphegor were obliterated on impact.
Meanwhile, Blood, lurking nearby, intercepted what he believed was a surprise arrow headed for him. He cut it cleanly mid-air with his blade.
But it was no ordinary arrow.
Asmodeus, watching from above, recognized it too late—a Death Arrow.
“Get out—!” he shouted, but before he could teleport, the arrow detonated.
Both Blood and Asmodeus were consumed in the blast.
From the shadows, Magorath emerged, eyes locked on Kaida, who now knelt—breathing heavily, drained from her spell.
He charged.
But Caleb was faster.
He blocked Magorath’s massive blade with his own and raised a glowing shield around them both.
The demon god roared, hammering at the barrier. But as he struck, a second wave of energy struck him from behind—
 a jet of flame as hot as the sun, fused with abyssal magic.
Magorath screamed as his body burned, his soul unraveling in fire and darkness.
Suddenly, arrows rained down from above.
Charly, standing among the demon gods, looked up and spotted the culprit—a lone archer on the castle’s highest spire.
With a smirk, he raised his hand and used his magic to reverse the arrows mid-flight.
They tore through the sky, redirected with deadly precision.
The Green Eye, a sacred artifact of Father Crow’s army, shattered under the barrage. Vornyx, the Eye’s guardian, was nearly slain.
But at the last moment, General Orynth leapt into the path, taking the worst of the impact.
Elsewhere, one of Father Crow’s elite assassins—also Orynth—engaged enemy flames infused with abyssal power.
 The unnatural fusion seared his face, taking his right eye.
He would’ve bled out…
…if not for Annabelle
Her hands glowed with green light as she knelt beside him, whispering ancient healing spells. His eye slowly regenerated—restored through her magic.
Back on the battlefield, Charly raised his voice.
“Archers are down!
 Attack!”
The demons surged forward like a wave of flame and fangs.
Caleb scooped up the exhausted Kaida and raced back toward the castle, while the other generals stepped forward to hold the line.
Father Crow watched the battlefield burn.
Smoke curled into the sky. The cries of the dying echoed off shattered stone. Magic cracked the air like thunder.
And then…
 He stepped down from the throne.
Halberd in hand. Aura rising.
 The green-black abyss swirled around his feet, coiling like smoke from a dying world.
It was time.
His turn.
He walked through the chaos—straight toward Charly.
The demon god stood at the heart of the battlefield, cloaked in violet flames, weaving spells with a bored expression.
As Father Crow approached, he grabbed a broken stone and hurled it with unnatural force.
Charly didn’t even flinch.
The rock stopped mid-air—hovered for a moment—then shot back with double the speed, slamming into Father Crow’s shoulder and cracking the ground behind him.
Charly grinned mockingly.
 “Really? You thought that would work?” he laughed. “You know I can’t be harmed by ranged attacks. Come on, you should remember that.”
Father Crow didn’t answer.
 He lunged.
The halberd carved the air, slicing toward Charly with brutal precision.
The demon god cursed under his breath and leapt back, barely avoiding the strike.
The gap closed too quickly.
Charly stumbled—he was a master of arcane destruction, not close-quarters combat. And Father Crow knew it.
Every swing of the halberd was heavier than the last, coated with abyssal fury. Sparks flew as blade met shield, magic clashed with metal.
Charly was on the defensive.
 Backpedaling. Struggling to create distance.
And Father Crow… kept coming.
Blow after blow drove Charly backward. For the first time in centuries, the smug demon god found himself on the retreat.
“You’re seriously annoying,” Charly spat, summoning a glyph beneath Father Crow’s feet.
It erupted in a blast of crimson magic, sending shards of stone and dust high into the air.
But through the smoke—
 Father Crow stepped forward, untouched. And furious.
“You think I’m letting you off easy,” he growled, aura flaring, “after you threw me out of your bar?”
Charly’s smile twitched. “That was just business—”
CRASH!
Father Crow’s halberd smashed down. Charly barely dodged, flipping backward as the strike split the stone floor. A violent shockwave rippled outward, knocking over lesser demons nearby.
“Okay, okay,” Charly muttered, brushing embers off his coat. “Now you’re just being dramatic.”
But his voice had lost its usual ease, and sweat shimmered on his brow.
Father Crow kept coming.
Desperate, Charly raised his hand—and rose-like crimson vines burst from the ground, reaching to bind Father Crow.
But Father Crow saw them.
And ripped them apart mid-surge, scattering thorns and petals across the field.
He charged again—relentless.
Charly flung his hand out, and a shimmering barrier formed between them.
“Okay—time out!” Charly shouted. “This is some bullshit.”
His voice cracked with frustration.
“Not only do you seem more prepared than we expected—your powers are absolute bullshit! And I know that’s rich coming from me. But your godlike strength is really starting to piss me off!”
He raised his hand and drew several glowing white circles into the air. The barrier vanished.
From the circles, holy energy burst outward, flooding the battlefield. At the same time, fresh rose-vines of light and thorns erupted from the ground, forcing Father Crow to retreat several steps, dodging gracefully.
At last, Charly had his distance.
“Did you forget?” Charly sneered. “I’m one of the very few demons that can use holy magic—and—”
Father Crow interrupted coldly, a smile tugging at his lips.
“—And that if one drop of my blood touches your petals, you’ll know all my powers, weaknesses, and spells.
 Yes, Charly. I’m aware.”
Charly blinked.
“You’re a white rose demon, one of the last of your cursed bloodline,” Father Crow continued. “And a dagger-tier god.”
Charly’s smile faded into a scowl. “And you still dare challenge me to a one-on-one?”
Father Crow stepped forward, halberd crackling with abyssal smoke and embers. His smile widened.
“For all of those reasons—and more—
 it’s going to feel so satisfying to kill you.”
Without a word, the battle resumed.
But this time—Charly had the upper hand.
The distance between them gave the demon god the space he needed to cast spell after spell, each one sharper, faster, and more precise than the last.
Father Crow struggled.
He’d known that closing the gap would be key—but he hadn’t realized just how brutal the distance would be.
Still, he pushed forward, weaving through holy vines and arcane blasts. Step by step, he fought to reach Charly again.
But just as he closed in—
 One of Charly’s rose-vines whipped around and slashed him across the torso, lifting him into the air and slamming him to the ground with brutal force.
For the first time in the fight—Father Crow bled.
Charly’s eyes gleamed. He raised his staff, and the blood was sucked from the air toward the glass chamber atop his scepter, swirling like ink in water.
Just before it reached his lips—
CRASH!
Father Crow surged forward and shattered the glass with a clean strike.
“Did you really think it would be that easy to drink my blood?” he growled, stepping past Charly.
“You little bastard,” Charly snapped, his smirk returning despite his frustration. “If you think that gives you an advantage, you’re wrong. I’ve got plenty of tricks left—and it’ll only take me two minutes to remake that vial.”
“I know,” Father Crow replied calmly. “But I only need a few seconds…”
He pointed past Charly.
“…for that to hit you.”
Charly turned—
His face dropped.
 “Oh, mother f—”
BOOM.
A massive blue-dark blast—a projectile forged from moonlight and dark energy—slammed into Charly from the side, obliterating half his body in a blinding eruption of light and force.
The blast was so powerful, it blew Father Crow backward, sending him skidding across the stone floor, cloak scorched and armor cracked.
But the blast didn’t stop there.
It roared across the battlefield—tearing through anything in its path—and finally collided with Satan himself, who had been observing from a high perch of blackened stone.
Both were erased in an instant.
Silence fell, broken only by the rumble of the fading energy echoing across the smoking field.
Father Crow rose slowly from the cracked ground, his boots crunching against ash and molten stone. He stared at the horizon, watching the blast’s afterglow drift like a dying aurora.
“Well,” he muttered, voice hoarse. “I’ll be damned. Gaster’s plan actually worked.”
From within the haze, something stirred.
A half-disintegrated Charly, scorched and missing chunks of flesh, managed to reform just enough of his face to glare.
“Well played… asshole,” he coughed, blood dribbling from his cracked lips. “You’re still banned from all my bars.”
And with that, he vaporized into smoke, retreating to whatever plane still held him together.

Two More Down. Four to Go.
The air stank of blood and burning magic.
Father Crow moved through the battlefield slowly, his halberd dragging behind him, the steel edge scraping sparks from the stone like a whispering omen. His presence pulled the very shadows closer.
He could feel it.
Static and Nightmare were gone—snuffed out. Their auras faded into the void, leaving only Mammon and Leviathan burning like dying stars in the distance.
But as he reached the heart of the battlefield, he was met with something unexpected.
Leviathan—the storm serpent, the devourer of fleets—was surrounded. Wounded. Weak. Dying.
And around him, Father Crow’s generals closed in, cutting down his scaled minions and pounding the god’s defenses into dust. The tide had turned.
But it wasn’t that sight that made Father Crow stop. It was the figure standing at the center of it all—Gaster Stone, his staff planted in the earth, face calm and collected.
Father Crow’s grip tightened. His halberd snapped into an offensive position, and he began walking toward him.
Step by step.
The ground cracked beneath his boots. The generals noticed but said nothing. They knew what was coming.
Just as the halberd was about to strike, a blade intercepted it—Koronis.
“Enough,” said Koronis. His voice was steady, but his eyes were tired. “He didn't expect the blast to be this powerful but it did the job so let it go” 
Father Crow’s eyes burned with abyssal fire.
“Don’t expect a thank you,” he growled, his halberd pressing against Koronis’s blade.
Koronis sighed. “I know.”
Behind him, Gaster Stone smiled, utterly unfazed.
“Well,” Gaster said cheerfully, “the all mighty father can't handle a blast”
Koronis didn’t even look back. “I will not block another attack for you.”
Gaster raised both hands in mock surrender. “I was only joking. It was a real pleasure, Father Crow. And with that…”
He snapped his fingers.
In a flash of light and dust, Gaster Stone, Koronis, and Byleistr vanished, leaving only the dead, the dying, and the distant echo of cruel laughter behind.
Father Crow stood there a moment longer, his halberd humming in his grip.
Then he turned toward the last fading aura—Mammon.
Mammon fell faster than expected.
Despite being one of the last standing demon gods, Mammon’s greed had made him predictable, and Gaster’s intel proved precise. It wasn’t long before the final blow was struck—and with it, the battle ended.
The demon gods were dead.
 Their armies broken.
 The war, won.
Father Crow stood atop the blood-soaked field, the storm above still crackling faintly with fading divine energy. He raised his halberd once, and the signal was clear: assemble.
Within moments, what remained of his army gathered in the throne hall. Only 64 generals remained—down from hundreds. The toll was heavy.
Father Crow’s voice echoed like thunder.
“Well done,” he began, cold and composed. “But disappointing. We’re down to sixty-four. A shameful number for a kingdom that just conquered Hell’s elite.”
He turned his gaze toward Caleb, now standing straight, though pale with exhaustion and bloodstains still fresh on his armor.
“Caleb,” Father Crow said, “you’ll resume your role as me. The Devil will be arriving soon to take me back. While I’m gone—reclaim all of our lost territory. All of it. Before I return.”
Caleb hesitated. “But… sir, we lost so many winged generals. Wouldn’t it be easier to just… kill the Devil too?”
That question made Father Crow stop.
Then slowly—he smiled.
“Did no one teach this boy anything about the Gods of Hell?” He turned to the room. “Very well. I’ll explain it once.”
He stepped forward, his voice dropping low and sharp.
“The Devil has the power of every demon under him. That includes the Fourteen Sins we just defeated. You think I—we—could take on a god who carries the strength of all of them combined? Then you are all fools.”
Caleb stepped forward again, desperate now. “Please, there must be something else we can do. We don’t have the numbers left. Just… don’t make me go back to pretending again.”
Father Crow’s face turned stone-cold.
“I don’t care,” he said. “Make it work. Lie. Manipulate. Conquer. That’s the job.”
 “If I return, and even one border is lost—I’ll punish all of you.”
He let that hang in the air.
Silence.
Then the generals dropped to one knee in unison, heads bowed.
“Yes, Father,” they said.
Father Crow turned his back to them, the shadows already stirring behind him—the Devil was coming.
And once again, he would walk into hell… alone.
“Hello, Father Crow,” said the Devil, lounging atop a throne of molten bones, his voice smooth as oil—and twice as slick.
“You did well—just as I expected. You killed them all. Well done, indeed.”
 He clapped slowly, mockingly, the sound echoing like cracks in the obsidian walls of Hell’s Court.
Father Crow stood motionless, halberd planted at his side.
 Sparks danced at the tip of the blade like restless spirits.
“I was expecting all Fourteen Sins,” he said, voice low and unreadable. “Yet only eleven showed. Why is that?”
The Devil’s grin widened.
“None of your business.”
A flicker of something dangerous lit in Father Crow’s eye.
“They’re not really dead… are they?”
The Devil chuckled, then clapped once—sharp, like thunder.
 “Oh? You noticed. Impressive. And yes—you’re correct.”
Father Crow’s lips curled into a cold, eager smile.
“Good,” he said. “I can’t wait to stab each one of them with my halberd. Again.”
“You really think you can?” the Devil mused, stretching lazily on his throne. “You’re lucky, you know. Leviathan and Mammon couldn’t access their full power in your realm. If they had…”
The air around Father Crow twisted. The abyss pulsed with rage.
 “You dare let them hold back against me?” he snarled.
The Devil’s laughter echoed like shattering glass.
“Must you always complain?” he said, waving a clawed hand. “You got what you wanted—victory, glory. And I got what I wanted.”
He stood.
The heat in the chamber spiked, the throne pulsing like a beating heart of fire.
“Now, let’s get down to business.”
His voice darkened.
“I could only find three hundred creatures. It wasn’t enough to trap you here forever—so I… got creative. I built scenarios, each shaped like the death wishes other beings once made against you. In them, you suffered. And this time—you died.”
He paused for effect, then continued.
“So far, out of the three hundred, you’ve only managed to counter 163 of them.”
He smiled wider.
“And you’ve died exactly 52,369 times.”
The number hung in the air like a guillotine.
“But don’t worry,” the Devil added. “I originally planned for one million deaths.”
Father Crow’s eyes narrowed.
“You want me to suffer longer.”
“Yes,” the Devil said simply, without shame.
 “But I’m willing to compromise.”
He descended from his throne, shadows spiraling around him like black serpents.
“I’ll restore the original challenge. Just the 300 creatures. There are 137 left who haven’t killed you yet.”
“But,” he added, stepping closer, “if you encounter any of the 163 creatures who have already killed you again, you’ll be free.”
He grinned, eyes glowing with malevolent curiosity.
“So tell me, Father Crow…”
“Will you die 137 more times…”
“Or will you encounter one of the 163 that already killed you?”
The room pulsed with silence, broken only by the Devil’s final words:
“I can’t wait to find out.”
After only fifty-three more deaths, Father Crow once again stood at the edge of battle—this time facing the Blue Flame God.
And then—
 everything froze.
Time stopped.
Flames hung still. Dust froze in midair. The roar of war vanished into silence.
The Devil appeared before him, stepping through a ripple in reality, arms lazily crossed.
“What a shame,” he sighed dramatically. “I was planning on you dying a little more. But oh well… a deal is a deal.”
He grinned.
“Take care, Father Crow. It was a pleasure torturing you.”
The Devil gave a mock salute.
“You’re free of all charges. Bye-bye.”
And with a snap of his fingers—
the world shattered.

Father Crow awoke in the heart of his castle.
At first, it felt normal.
But something was off.
There was a stillness—not the peace of victory, but the quiet that follows deception. He moved through the halls, talons clicking on stone.
The deeper he went, the stronger the wrongness became.
And then he found it.
A blooming garden—right inside his castle. Roses, moon lilies, and thorny vines tangled together around two chairs and a tea table.
Sitting calmly in one of the chairs was none other than Zila, the Witch Goddess of the Undead.
“How the fuck did none of my generals notice you?” Father Crow growled, summoning his halberd—it appeared in his hand with a pulse of green-black smoke.
Zila smiled sweetly. “Oh, that’s because I only wanted to see you, silly.”
Without another word, Father Crow lunged.
But Zila was fast. She rose in one smooth motion, her scythe clashing with his halberd mid-swing. The air cracked with violent magic.
“What do you want?” he demanded, eyes locked with hers.
Zila’s expression cooled. “The Devil might have forgiven your sins…”
 Her voice dropped like frost.
 “…but I haven’t.”
“If you think your little chain trick will work twice,” he hissed, pressing harder, “you’re more foolish than I thought.”
Zila smirked. “Cute. Someone’s feeling confident.”
With a sudden twist, Father Crow knocked her off balance and kicked her hard into the stone wall. Before she could recover, he hurled the halberd with deadly precision.
She barely dodged. The blade sliced clean through her robe and struck the stone behind her with a violent crack.
“I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” Zila laughed, raising her hands. “Can we start over?”
Father Crow shifted into his child form, his speed increasing, and summoned his rapier as he stepped forward, blade poised to strike.
“I won’t ask again. What do you want?”
Zila blinked. “Owo, you’re so cute—I didn’t know you could do that.”
Seeing the look in his eyes, she added quickly, “But what I want… is to have a cup of tea with you.”
 Father Crow’s expression twisted in confusion.
“Well, yes,” Zila said cheerfully, brushing ash from her sleeve. “I find you… fascinating. I think having a conversation would be fun. And I like tea.”
“Talking about what, exactly?” he asked, still wary.
“Whatever you want,” she replied. “I’ll share what I know. You share what you know.”
“And why would I ever agree to that?” Father Crow asked. “I can acquire any knowledge I desire.”
“Oh, certainly. You have access to the knowledge of the living. But I…”
 She leaned in, her voice soft and sinister.
 “I know what the dead knew. Their secrets. Their regrets. Their last whispers before the void took them.”
She tilted her head. “And besides—don’t you think it would be… fun?
 Two powerful beings. Both capable of killing the other at any moment. Just sipping tea… and talking.”
Father Crow let out a dark, low laugh.
“I’ve seen your tricks. What could you possibly—”
CRACK.
Zila slammed her scythe into the ground.
Instantly, pale undead hands erupted from the earth, gripping Father Crow’s arms and legs, yanking him down with unnatural strength. He struggled—hard—but he couldn’t break free.
“You forget,” Zila whispered, stepping close with inhuman grace, “I’m the Witch Goddess of the Undead.
 And you haven’t seen half of what I can do.”
She walked over, elegant and unbothered, and gently touched the edge of her scythe to his throat.
“So… what will it be?”
Father Crow’s eyes burned with fury. But finally, he spoke.
“Fine,” he said coldly. “But nothing we share reaches another soul. Dead or alive.”
Zila smiled, fangs glinting behind her lips.
“But of course.”
She turned back toward the garden, motioning to the empty chair beside hers.
“Now then… milk or honey?”
“Not now,” Father Crow said sharply, shifting back to his true form. “I have generals to manage.”
Zila sat back down, unfazed.
“That’s okay. I’ll be right here. Waiting.
 Take your time.”
“Not now,” Father Crow muttered, pulling free as the hands released him. “I have generals to manage.”
Zila sat back down, completely unfazed.
“That’s okay,” she said with a warm smile. “I’ll be right here. Waiting.
 Take your time.”
Father Crow entered the war chamber.
Dark flames flickered from the braziers lining the cold stone walls. The air was heavy, pulsing with restrained power. At the center, Father Crow stood—his presence alone silencing the room.
Only forty-five generals stood before him.
His gaze swept across them like a blade.
“Caleb,” he said, voice low but sharp.
Caleb stepped forward, tension coiled in his shoulders.
“Well, sir… we didn’t expect your return so soon. We thought we had more time. Fifteen generals are still out reclaiming lost territory. We’ve nearly recovered ninety-five percent of what was lost. And… we’ve lost contact with five.”
A heavy pause settled over the chamber.
Father Crow exhaled through his nose—a slow, controlled breath that felt heavier than a scream.
“You don’t need to be nervous, Caleb,” he said calmly. “You still have value.
 I won’t kill you—yet.”
He snapped his fingers.
Caleb’s body shimmered briefly before shifting—his form returning to its human disguise.
“Take my assassins. Find the fifteen. Make sure they finish what they started. And track the missing five—dead or alive. Now go.”
Caleb bowed quickly and exited.
As the doors closed behind him, Father Crow turned back to the others.
 His expression darkened.
“Now that Caleb is gone…” he said slowly, “one of you better explain to me how the hell none of you noticed there’s a witch in my castle.”
Silence.
Finally, one general stepped forward, hesitating.
 “We confirmed two of the missing five are dead, sir. We… assumed she was here doing her godly duty.”
That was a mistake.
In the blink of an eye, Father Crow crossed the room.
He slammed the general into the stone wall, one hand crushing his throat. The impact cracked the stone behind him.
“I have never allowed a god into my castle,” he snarled.
 “Not for death.
 Not for mercy.
 Not for prophecy.”
His grip tightened—black energy crackling around his fingers.
“So tell me… if I kill you right now—
 will any god come save you?
 Will any lift a hand for you?”
The general’s eyes widened in terror.
“Let’s find out.”
CRACK.
With a single twist, Father Crow crushed his windpipe and dropped the lifeless body to the floor with a dull, final thud.
He turned to the others, eyes burning.
“Anyone else want to play stupid?”
Silence.
“Good. Then listen carefully.”
His voice was sharp as ice.
“First: reinforce all held territories at double strength. That way you’ll be free to help the others reclaim what we lost. I want one hundred and fifty percent of our territory back—nothing less.
Second: bring me your best generals.
 It seems I need to find replacements for the winged ones we lost.”
He pointed to the corpse on the ground.
“And let me make this clear—if I find out any of you allowed gods into this castle again, he won’t be the only one punished.”
He paused.
“Am I clear?”
“Yes, Father!” they shouted in unison.
Satisfied, Father Crow gestured for them to leave. One by one, they filed out—silent, swift, and shaken.

He returned to the garden.
The same cursed, blooming place.
And there, as if no time had passed, Zila still sat—legs crossed, tea in hand, her expression serene.
“Welcome back,” she said sweetly.
 “Did everything go well?”
Father Crow stood beside the garden’s twisted flowers, his gaze locked on Zila.
“Tell me,” he said coldly, “I’ve heard witches often split into two paths—warriors and mages. Is that true?”
Zila gave a casual nod.
 “Yes, that’s correct.”
“Which one are you?”
She smiled.
 “A mage, obviously.”
Without warning, Father Crow attacked.
His form blurred as he shifted between weapons—halberd strikes, dagger throws, rapier thrusts. Each attack was precise, brutal, unpredictable.
But Zila moved like water through fire, countering with uncanny grace—her scythe sweeping wide arcs, necrotic shields flickering into existence, bones rising from the garden to block strikes.
As their flurry ended in a short stand-off, Father Crow’s expression darkened.
“Interesting…” he muttered.
 “What else are you lying about? And where are the souls of my two generals?”
Zila didn’t flinch.
 “First—I'm not lying. I am the Goddess of the Undead. My magic draws strength from corpses—and we are, conveniently, in a graveyard.”
 She motioned to the earth beneath them.
 **“Every warrior buried here—his speed, his strength, his skills—I can borrow them.”
“Second… I don’t have their souls.”**
Father Crow’s eyes narrowed.
 “Then where are they?”
Zila slowly pointed behind him.
Father Crow turned—
—and saw it.
A towering nightmarish creature, cloaked in smoke and bone, grinning with jagged teeth. In its claws, it clutched two glowing souls—tortured, flickering, unmistakably his fallen generals.
In that moment, His pupils flared.
 His entire body radiated with fury. Shadows twisted around him like wings.
The creature saw it.
And in the next instant, Father Crow was on it.
He slammed his fist into the creature’s face with such force that it shattered through three stone walls, splinters and ash exploding outward like a cannon blast.
The castle shook.
The garden wilted.
And Father Crow’s glowing eyes didn’t waver.
Father Crow kept beating the creature—until it was nothing more than a pile of crushed bone and black ooze. Its face no longer resembled anything alive. The souls trembled in its claw before Father Crow yanked them free.
Father Crow kept beating the creature—again and again—until it was nothing more than a heap of crushed bone and black ooze.
 Its face no longer resembled anything alive. The souls trembled in its claw before Father Crow yanked them free with a sharp pull.
Covered in blood, he turned and walked back to the garden.
Zila was still there.
Sitting.
 Drinking tea.
 Completely unbothered.
“I’ve refused to drink tea with you for the last forty-five minutes. Why are you still here?” Father Crow asked, his voice flat, his cloak still slick with blood.
“It’s been fifty-five minutes,” Zila corrected with a sly grin. “But who’s counting?”
“You’re not leaving until I drink the tea, are you?”
“Correct,” she said simply.
With a tired grunt, Father Crow sat down across from her, the grass beneath him scorching slightly from his aura. He took a sip—bracing for the worst—but was surprised to find the tea was… good. Smooth. Calming.
His expression softened for just a moment.
“Fine, you win,” he muttered. “We can do this once a month if you want. So—what did you want?”
Zila studied him for a long beat, her tone unexpectedly soft.
“I wanted to know… are you happy?”
Father Crow didn’t answer right away.
 His gaze drifted to the souls he’d just freed, then to the distant trees beyond the courtyard. A quiet bitterness settled over him.
“That’s a stupid question. Are you trying to therapy me?”
Zila smiled knowingly.
 “No, no. Of course not. Trying to heal your twisted mind would be a waste of time. Shiashlian already tried. Didn’t really work out, did it?”
Father Crow glared at her, his expression darkening.
She leaned back casually.
 “Anyway, I was wondering—why did you kill that general of yours? His soul was quite powerful. Seemed like a waste.”
Father Crow answered without hesitation.
“Before I summoned them, I checked who had done the least. He was powerful, yes—but lazy, disrespectful, and arrogant. I don’t need powerful. I need loyalty. He was neither.”
Zila nodded slowly.
 “Interesting. If you like, I can bring back the two you lost.”
“No,” Father Crow said coldly.
 “Stop stalling. Why are you really here? Don’t make me ask again.”
Zila’s aura shifted, the playfulness draining away.
“Nothing gets past you anymore,” she said softly, sipping her tea. “Oh well. We both know we’ll never see eye to eye. But as the saying goes… keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.”
“Finally,” Father Crow smirked.
 “You stop lying. And as you said—you’re playing a dangerous game, drinking tea with the one you plan to kill. I thought killing wasn’t your thing.”
Zila stared into her cup.
“It’s been a long time since we first met. And not long ago… I was freed too. But I’m still the same witch. I want to do good. I just know now that doing good… sometimes requires doing what must be done.”
She looked up, eyes glowing faintly.
“That includes keeping a very close eye on you—literally and metaphorically. You’re dangerous. You killed Shiashlian.”
Father Crow’s grin widened.
“So. Revenge after all.”
“No. I warned him. I knew you’d kill him. He didn’t listen. I’m not here for revenge.”
 She rose slowly, setting her cup aside.
 “I’m here because I believe the Devil let you out too early. That’s why I’m really here.”
Father Crow set down his empty cup with deliberate finality.
“Is that so? Well, you can try. But it won’t be easy. I have other things to do, so clean this garden of your traps and leave. And if you’re still here when I return…”
His hand brushed the hilt of his halberd.
“I’ll kill you.”
Zila gave a mocking curtsy.
 “No need to be so hostile. It was a pleasure as always. Until we meet again, Father Crow.”
She vanished in a swirl of gray mist, leaving nothing but the faint scent of tea lingering in the cursed garden.
Father Crow stepped through the rift and entered the realm where one of his fallen generals had died.
He didn’t come for diplomacy.
 He came for revenge.
The great castle loomed before him, its banners still waving proudly in the night wind. But that pride burned away in an instant when he arrived.
He killed everyone.
Every soldier.
 Every courtier.
 Even the king and queen.
And he did it with such precise cruelty that it made the castle feel like a grave.
Only the summoner remained alive—the one responsible for calling forth the nightmare creature that had killed his general. Father Crow knocked him out cold and left him to wake in a hell of his own making.
When the summoner finally stirred, he found himself in the castle throne room.
His eyes darted wildly.
The walls…
They were covered in the butchered remains of everyone he had ever served beside. Arms, legs, and faces were pinned like grotesque trophies. Even the king and queen were nailed side by side at the top of the throne dais, their lifeless eyes staring down at him.
The summoner’s stomach twisted. He had seen horrors before—he had dabbled in the darkest of arts—but this? This was beyond anything he could stomach.
He vomited.
And in his panic, he ran.
The summoner fled the castle and made for his hometown, sprinting through the dark woods until his lungs burned. He reached the village just before dawn, soaked in sweat and terror, but relief washed over him when he saw the familiar rooftops.
Home. Safe.
He felt no one behind him. He sensed no shadow stalking him.
He allowed himself to collapse in his parents’ house, too exhausted to think, and eventually drifted into uneasy sleep.
When he woke, the smell hit him first.
He opened his eyes and froze.
They were dead.
His parents. His siblings. Every loved one he had. Their bodies were torn apart and pinned to the walls of the small home in the same grotesque pattern as the castle.
Tears blurred his vision as he staggered outside, choking on panic.
But there was no escape.
The village streets were lined with stakes, and the corpses of every villager—friends, neighbors, children—were impaled upon them, their blood dripping into the dirt.
And in the center of it all…
stood Father Crow.
His halberd was in his hand, black smoke coiling around it like a serpent. His presence made the world feel smaller, the air colder, reality itself tremble.
The summoner collapsed to his knees, terror overwhelming him.
“Why…?” he whispered.
Father crow stepped forward, halberd in hand, each footfall heavier than the last. His voice was cold as steel.
“Because what you summoned got its hands on my generals’ souls,” he began, his eyes locked on the trembling summoner. “Naturally, I assumed your creature was the killer. But he was too weak. There’s no way he killed one of my generals—not alone. So I came to find you…”
He tilted his head, studying the man with visible contempt.
“And I’ve got to say—I’m disappointed. You’re weaker than the thing you summoned. How in Hell did someone as pathetic as you ever get control of such a creature?”
The summoner’s lips trembled, but he said nothing.
Father Crow waved his halberd dismissively.
 “Doesn’t matter. What does matter is that I know you had powerful allies. And I don’t have the time to hunt them all down. So…”
He stepped closer.
“Will you join me? Will you help me find them? I’ll give you the power you need to kill them.”
The summoner stiffened, anger flickering through his terror.
 “No! I will never join the side of some psychopath!”
Father Crow’s expression barely shifted.
 “Yeah… I thought so.”
He sighed as though this was all tiresome.
“Your soul is weak anyway. You wouldn’t have been much use to me. And to think… I considered you as a possible replacement.”
 His black eyes hardened.
 “What a waste of time.
…Well, almost a complete waste of time.”
The summoner blinked, confused.
“Your king and queen,” Father Crow continued, “their souls will be useful. So I’ll be taking them.”
His voice dropped into a near whisper.
 “Oh, and don’t worry—I’ll let your soul go to the afterlife, or whatever excuse for one you have in this realm, after you die. If you’re reborn…”
He leaned in close, his voice venomous.
“…try to find a hobby that doesn’t involve the dark arts. You’re clearly too weak for it. Because if we meet again…”
He let the threat hang in the air.
 “…I won’t show you mercy.”
The summoner’s voice cracked. “That’s what you call mercy?!”
“Yes,” Father Crow said simply, his halberd resting on his shoulder. “Because I’m capable of much, much worse.
For example…”
He snapped his fingers.
“General Plague. Come.”
A portal opened behind him, black smoke pouring out. Through it stepped a hulking undead crow over two meters tall, its bandaged form like a cursed mummy. In each clawed hand, it carried a massive greatsword.
The creature said nothing. Its glowing eyes locked onto the summoner like a predator scenting prey.
“Plague,” Father Crow commanded, his voice carrying the weight of death itself.
 “Kill everything you see in this realm. Find every single soul and do as you please—torture them, turn them, destroy them. I don’t care.
…Except for this one.”
He pointed at the summoner.
“This one you simply kill. Quickly.”
General Plague gave a single slow nod, the chains around its shoulders rattling.
“Well,” Father Crow said, stepping back and twirling his halberd with casual precision,
 “I’ll take my leave. Report back to me only after you’ve either turned everyone into the undead… or left nothing alive at all.”
And with that, Father Crow disappeared, leaving the summoner alone with General Plague and the echo of his final words.
Father Crow gathered his generals once again.
 The war chamber was silent as he stepped into the center, his aura thick with power.
“Before we begin,” he said, his voice cold but deliberate, “Doctor… I’m impressed by your creation. Plague is quite the weapon. It’s only been a few hours, but I can already see the progress he’s made.”
Emily bowed her head. “Thank you, Father.”
“Now then…” Father Crow’s black eyes shifted to Caleb. “Caleb. What is our status?”
Caleb stepped forward, stiff and nervous.
 “Well, sir, we’ve reclaimed most of the lost territory… but there are still a few areas—”
“Didn’t I tell you,” Father Crow cut him off, his tone darkening, “that I wanted all of it back? And more?”
Caleb swallowed. “Yes, Father. But… we saw that you personally handled one of the regions. Another, we’re struggling to even find where the missing general disappeared. And…” He hesitated.
Father Crow’s voice sharpened. “And?”
“And there’s one more territory we… failed to conquer,” Caleb admitted.
“Failed?” Father Crow’s voice cracked like a whip, and the room went cold.
“Yes, Father,” Caleb said quickly. “There’s a warrior holding the area. He’s… very powerful. We suspect it’s the Overlord Desert King, but he has more abilities than what we know of him. Our forces can’t beat him.”
Father Crow exhaled heavily through his nose, a sound that made the generals flinch.
 “Fine. I’ll take care of it myself,” he said at last. Then his gaze locked on Caleb.
“But, Caleb… this is your last chance.
 Next time I ask for a report, I expect to hear that you’ve conquered everything I demanded.”
Caleb stiffened, bowing low. “Yes, Father.”
“At least this time,” Father Crow continued, “you can take any general you want to assist you. I don’t care who you have to kill or sacrifice—just make it happen.”
“Yes, Father,” Caleb repeated.
Father Crow turned, his gaze sweeping over the remaining generals.
“And the rest of you… you have a little more time. When I return, I expect each of you to have found the strongest warrior you can present to me. Because when I come back…”
He paused, letting the weight of his words settle like an executioner’s blade.
“I’ll be testing them. Personally.”
The room filled with voices as the generals dropped to one knee.
 “Yes, Father!”
Satisfied, Father Crow stepped back, his halberd materializing in a storm of shadow.
“Good. Then prepare yourselves. When I return…”
 His eyes burned with cold fire.
 “Failure will no longer be tolerated.”
Father Crow rose from his throne, halberd in hand.
“Dismissed.”
The war chamber emptied in seconds, the generals vanishing like leaves scattered by a storm. Only shadows and silence remained.
Once the last echo of footsteps faded, Father Crow vanished in a surge of black smoke and reappeared beneath the scorching desert sun.
The desert stretched endlessly, broken only by crumbling towers and the ruins of ancient temples long claimed by time. Heat rippled across the cracked stone as Father Crow advanced, his halberd dragging across the sand with a slow metallic scrape.
Then he saw him.
The Desert King.
The overlord sat cross-legged in the sand, motionless as a statue. His sword rested upright at his side, hands draped loosely across his knees. His entire form was cloaked and covered, concealing his features in shadow.
“Father Crow,” the Desert King said at last, his voice a low rumble that carried like wind over stone.
 “You do remember that overlords are forbidden from fighting one another over territory.”
Father Crow’s steps didn’t slow.
“Desert King,” he said evenly. “I apologize for my idiotic generals. Apparently, they couldn’t tell it was you. But to be fair…”
He stopped several paces away, tilting his head slightly.
“I don’t know much about you either. Out of all the overlords, you’re the most mysterious. You never share anything. In fact…” He smirked faintly. “I think these are the most words I’ve ever heard you speak.”
The Desert King didn’t reply.
“But I do know one thing,” Father Crow continued, his tone sharpening. “The reason you haven’t reported me to Charly is because you want to fight me outside his rules. Isn’t that right?”
Still, the Desert King remained silent, though his presence seemed to grow heavier.
Father Crow spun the halberd once in his hand.
“Let’s make a deal,” he said. “If I win, you give me my territory back and tell me everything I want to know about you. If you win… I’ll report myself and tell you whatever you want to know.”
The Desert King rose slowly, pulling his massive sword from the ground with a single smooth motion.
He pointed the blade toward Father Crow.
“Don’t hold back.”
Father Crow’s grin widened, abyssal smoke rolling off his shoulders.
“Wouldn’t dream of it.”
The duel between the two overlords was as brutal and precise as expected—every strike a test of speed and skill, every counter lethal.
Father Crow lunged from above with a feint, his halberd streaking through the air in a blur of abyssal smoke.
The Desert King reacted instantly.
 He hurled his massive sword upward, intercepting what he thought was the killing blow.
But it was a trick.
Father Crow’s real attack came from the front, the halberd cutting a vicious arc aimed to end the fight then and there.
He was certain the battle was over.
He was wrong.
At the last second, the Desert King unleashed a sudden torrent of fire, the blast striking Father Crow full in the chest and sending him flying backward through the air.
Before he could recover, the Desert King’s sword—still connected by its unseen chains—whipped downward like a guillotine, aimed squarely at Father Crow.
Father Crow managed to block at the very last moment, the halberd catching the blade in a shower of sparks.
 But the impact rattled through his entire body, the force driving him deep into the sand.
He grit his teeth, forcing the sword back with a grunt.
“I really hate that sword of yours,” Father Crow spat as he regained his footing. “Connected to chains, giving you both long range and close… and now fire?”
His voice sharpened with curiosity—and a touch of irritation.
“I wonder what else you can do.”
The Desert King didn’t answer. His silent stance was answer enough.
Father Crow’s grip tightened on the halberd, shadows curling around his arms like living smoke.
“Fine. Guess I’ll find out the hard way.”
With a sudden burst of speed, he launched forward once more, halberd poised to carve through steel and stone alike.
Father Crow returned to his castle, stalking the halls until he found Caleb.
The young commander stiffened as soon as Father Crow approached, nerves visible in the way his hands tightened at his sides.
Father Crow stopped just in front of him, placing one clawed hand slowly on Caleb’s head.
 “Caleb… next time you fail—”
SLAM!
He smashed Caleb’s head to the ground with enough force to crack the stone beneath him.
“—know the fucking difference between an overlord and someone who isn’t!”
Caleb gasped, dazed, blood trailing down his forehead.
From across the room, Velterra burst out laughing.
 “Hahaha! You lost to him too!”
Father Crow’s head turned slowly, his eyes narrowing.
 “Careful what you say, Velterra… or I’ll take your other arm.”
Velterra smirked, leaning casually against the wall.
 “If you take my other arm, you’ll lose one of your best assassins. That would be a shame, wouldn’t it?”
“I liked you better when you were afraid of me,” Father Crow said coldly.
“Oh, don’t get me wrong,” Velterra replied, voice dripping with mock cheer. “I still fear you. But this? This is too funny.
Now then, sir… let Caleb go. It was my idea, not his.”
“Oh, is that so?” Father Crow’s voice dropped, dangerous.
Then—he lunged.
Velterra reacted fast, drawing his weapon and blocking the halberd’s strike with a shower of sparks.
 “Nice try,” Velterra grinned.
But Father Crow only smiled.
He shifted instantly into his child form, closing the distance before Velterra could adjust. He dropped low and snapped Velterra’s feet beneath him, breaking them both with a sickening crack.
Velterra screamed in pain.
 “Why, sir?!”
Father Crow stood over him, cold and unflinching.
 “Because you need to remember there are worse things than dying… or losing your second arm.”
He turned, halberd dissolving into black smoke.
“Oh, right,” he added, glancing back at the writhing Velterra. “I almost forgot—I have to test the generals’ champions.
Remember, Velterra… don’t fuck with me.”
And with that, Father Crow left the room, his steps echoing like the toll of a warning bell.
“Oh, and before you go—can you do something about Velterra?” Father Crow asked, his tone casual but commanding.
“Yes, sir,” Annabelle replied, stepping over to the injured assassin. With a glow of magic, she began healing his wounds.
“Thank you, sir,” Velterra muttered as he lay on the ground, still catching his breath.
“Get up,” Father Crow said coldly. “We have work to do.”
From that day on, Father Crow began to hold back on his grand plans.
Instead, he started keeping a rotten, twisted routine:
Once a month, he met with Zila, sharing bitter tea and stranger conversations.


Almost daily, he went on strolls through ruined lands, hunting for broken, forgotten creatures—lost souls, malformed beasts, cursed wanderers. Anything fractured enough to mold.


He forced his generals to bring their champions regularly, testing them in brutal trials.


Whenever a winged general died, another would be chosen—usually through blood, violence, or betrayal.


His aggressive nature became infamous. The legends whispered:
If you see him—hide.
 If he sees you—pray.
 And if he’s interested in you… run.
But worst of all?
If you're broken enough to be desperate—if you're willing to do anything just to rise again—then know this:
 Father Crow will find you.
