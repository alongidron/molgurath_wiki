# Lore


Vorakhel was once an ordinary stone demon—but one burdened by thought.

Stone demons were renowned for their intelligence and immense strength. Yet despite this, they were treated as little more than tools. Most were forced into roles as fortress builders or soldiers on endless battlefields. They possessed power, but no freedom. No voice. Even their king showed no interest in changing their fate.

That injustice gnawed at Vorakhel.

If no one else would act, then he would.

But change required power—power far beyond that of an ordinary stone demon. Whispers spoke of an ancient legend: the Ancient Red Demon Flash, a being said to grant unimaginable strength. Most dismissed it as nothing more than rumor. No proof existed.

Except Vorakhel intended to become that proof.

He abandoned his former life and pledged himself to the Ancient Red Demon’s army—the feared Red Knights. Through relentless combat and calculated loyalty, Vorakhel rose through their ranks. With every battle, he gathered knowledge: of the Knights, their command structure, and most importantly, of the Red Demon himself.

During his campaigns, Vorakhel uncovered a forbidden spell—one capable of disabling a demon’s magic entirely.

Later, in the aftermath of a brutal battle, he found it: a holy blade taken from the corpse of a fallen angel. Any demon who touched such a weapon would be destroyed instantly. But Vorakhel was not reckless. He spent years perfecting a barrier spell—one that would allow him to wield the blade without being consumed by it.

And then, he waited.

When the moment finally came, Vorakhel entered the Red Demon’s chambers alone. Calmly—almost reverently—he wiped the blood from his blade. The Ancient Red Demon sensed something was wrong, but before he could react, Vorakhel drove his sword into the ground.

The spell activated.

The Red Demon lunged forward, eager to strike down an exposed traitor—only to realize the truth.

His magic was gone.

Confusion flashed across his face.

That was when Vorakhel drew a second sword, wrapped carefully in cloth. Slowly, deliberately, he pulled the fabric away, revealing the gleaming purity of the holy blade.

Protected by his barrier, Vorakhel raised the weapon.

For the first time in history, the Ancient Red Demon stood powerless before a stone demon who refused to remain a tool.

The Ancient Red Demon was not willing to surrender.

Stripped of his magic, he roared and charged, swinging his massive weapon with raw, furious strength. But brute force alone was no match for Vorakhel’s discipline. Years of battle, study, and patience showed their worth. Vorakhel moved with precision, reading every strike, every opening.

Steel met steel.

The clash lasted only minutes—but to the Red Demon, it felt like humiliation stretched into eternity. One final misstep was all Vorakhel needed.

With a single decisive motion, he cut the Ancient Red Demon in half.

The chamber fell silent.

Standing over the corpse, Vorakhel made a decision that would define his future. From that moment on, he would collect the weapons of those he defeated—trophies of power taken, not given.

Then, without hesitation, Vorakhel consumed the Ancient Red Demon Flash.

The transformation was immediate and overwhelming. Power flooded his body, reshaping him into something no stone demon had ever been. When the Red Knights arrived, they did not question what they saw.

They kneeled.

Vorakhel became the new leader of the Red Knights.

But his work was not finished.

He returned to the Stone Demon Kingdom and challenged its king to a duel. The ruler who had ignored his people—who had allowed stone demons to live as tools—accepted, confident in his authority.

That confidence lasted only moments.

With his newfound power, Vorakhel defeated the king with ease.

And in that victory, the era of silent stone demons ended.
