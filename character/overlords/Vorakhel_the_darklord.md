# Lore


Vorakhel was once an ordinary stone demon—but one burdened by thought.

Stone demons were renowned for their intelligence and immense strength. Yet despite this, they were treated as little more than tools. Most were forced into roles as fortress builders or soldiers on endless battlefields. They possessed power, but no freedom. No voice. Even their king showed no interest in changing their fate.

That injustice gnawed at Vorakhel.

If no one else would act, then he would.

But change required power—power far beyond that of an ordinary stone demon. Whispers spoke of an ancient legend: the Ancient Red Demon Flash, a being said to grant unimaginable strength. Most dismissed it as nothing more than rumor. No proof existed.

Except Vorakhel intended to become that proof.

He abandoned his former life and pledged himself to the Ancient Red Demon’s army—the feared Red Knights. Through relentless combat and calculated loyalty, Vorakhel rose through their ranks. With every battle, he gathered knowledge: of the Knights, their command structure, and most importantly, of the Red Demon himself.

During his campaigns, Vorakhel uncovered a forbidden spell—one capable of disabling a demon’s magic entirely.

Later, in the aftermath of a brutal battle, he found it: a holy blade taken from the corpse of a fallen angel. Any demon who touched such a weapon would be destroyed instantly. But Vorakhel was not reckless. He spent years perfecting a barrier spell—one that would allow him to wield the blade without being consumed by it.

And then, he waited.

When the moment finally came, Vorakhel entered the Red Demon’s chambers alone. Calmly—almost reverently—he wiped the blood from his blade. The Ancient Red Demon sensed something was wrong, but before he could react, Vorakhel drove his sword into the ground.

The spell activated.

The Red Demon lunged forward, eager to strike down an exposed traitor—only to realize the truth.

His magic was gone.

Confusion flashed across his face.

That was when Vorakhel drew a second sword, wrapped carefully in cloth. Slowly, deliberately, he pulled the fabric away, revealing the gleaming purity of the holy blade.

Protected by his barrier, Vorakhel raised the weapon.

For the first time in history, the Ancient Red Demon stood powerless before a stone demon who refused to remain a tool.

The Ancient Red Demon was not willing to surrender.

Stripped of his magic, he roared and charged, swinging his massive weapon with raw, furious strength. But brute force alone was no match for Vorakhel’s discipline. Years of battle, study, and patience showed their worth. Vorakhel moved with precision, reading every strike, every opening.

Steel met steel.

The clash lasted only minutes—but to the Red Demon, it felt like humiliation stretched into eternity. One final misstep was all Vorakhel needed.

With a single decisive motion, he cut the Ancient Red Demon in half.

The chamber fell silent.

Standing over the corpse, Vorakhel made a decision that would define his future. From that moment on, he would collect the weapons of those he defeated—trophies of power taken, not given.

Then, without hesitation, Vorakhel consumed the Ancient Red Demon Flash.

The transformation was immediate and overwhelming. Power flooded his body, reshaping him into something no stone demon had ever been. When the Red Knights arrived, they did not question what they saw.

They kneeled.

Vorakhel became the new leader of the Red Knights.

But his work was not finished.

He returned to the Stone Demon Kingdom and challenged its king to a duel. The ruler who had ignored his people—who had allowed stone demons to live as tools—accepted, confident in his authority.

That confidence lasted only moments.

With his newfound power, Vorakhel defeated the king with ease.

And in that victory, the era of silent stone demons ended.

Freedom changed the stone demons—but it also revealed something else.

Vorakhel was not only a conqueror. He was a creator.

Among his people, he had long been unmatched in golemcraft. Where others shaped stone through brute force, Vorakhel carved will and purpose into his creations. His golems did not tire, did not fear, and did not rebel. Entire fortresses could be raised—or crushed—by his designs alone.

Such mastery drew attention.

Mammon, lord of bargains and endless greed, approached Vorakhel with an offer worthy of his nature. In exchange for an endless supply of golems—an army that required no pay, no loyalty, and no rest—Mammon would break the ancient curses placed upon the stone demons. Curses that bound them to servitude long before Vorakhel’s rebellion ever began.

It was not compassion.

It was a transaction.

Vorakhel accepted.

Mammon kept his word. The hidden bindings that enslaved the stone demons shattered at last, their chains breaking not through mercy, but through profit. In return, Mammon gained an army of stone without hunger or hesitation—while Vorakhel secured something no throne alone could guarantee.

Permanent freedom for his people.

After a time, victory began to feel hollow.

Even as king, even as leader of the Red Knights, Vorakhel found no satisfaction in triumph. Power had freed his people—but it no longer tested him. Battles ended too quickly. Enemies fell too easily. Challenge had vanished.

And so, Vorakhel began to desire something greater than rule.

He began to desire ascension.

He set his sights on a higher existence: becoming an Overlord.

Vorakhel gathered every fragment of knowledge he could find—ancient texts, forbidden records, and whispered truths torn from defeated enemies. What he discovered unsettled him. Ascension was far more complex than consuming the Ancient Red Demon’s power.
Yet within that research, Vorakhel found an opening.

The title of Dark Lord.

To become the Dark Lord was to stand at the threshold of Overlordhood—a position of immense authority and influence. And unlike the Overlords, the Dark Lord stood alone, unprotected by alliance or covenant.

The battle itself surprised him.

Defeating the Dark Lord proved far easier than Vorakhel had expected. Only after the victory did he understand why.

The Dark Lord was not part of the Overlords’ Alliance.

He had been locked in an eternal struggle against the Light Lord, weakened by centuries of unending conflict—drained by a war that never truly ended.

When Vorakhel claimed the title of Dark Lord, the truth revealed itself in full.

The crown was not a throne.

It was a battlefield.

Bound to the role, Vorakhel was dragged into the internal war against the Light Lord—a conflict older than kingdoms. Victory over the Dark Lord had not elevated him beyond the struggle.

It had chained him to it.

And for the first time since his rise began, Vorakhel understood a bitter truth:

Power did not always mean freedom.

Vorakhel refused to accept an eternal war.

For years, he poured everything he possessed into ending the conflict. Strategy, overwhelming force, forbidden weapons—nothing was withheld. At last, after relentless campaigns and countless sacrifices, Vorakhel’s armies struck down the Light Lord.

For a single moment, silence fell across the battlefield.

Then the sky split.

A blinding beam of pure light descended from beyond the world itself. Its force erased Vorakhel’s armies in an instant, reducing victory to ash. The shockwave hurled Vorakhel back to his castle, his body shattered, his triumph undone.

When the light finally faded, the truth stood revealed.

From the remnants of the fallen Light Lord, a new Light Lord was born.

The war had not ended.

It had reset.

As the echoes of destruction settled, Vorakhel finally understood the final words spoken by the Dark Lord he had slain—words he had once dismissed as bitterness, now revealed as warning.

The war between Light and Dark was never meant to be won.

It was a mechanism.

A cycle enforced by powers far above Lords and kings alike. Dark Lords and Light Lords were not rulers—they were functions, endlessly replaced, endlessly sacrificed, to preserve a balance none of them had chosen.

And now Vorakhel, for all his power, was bound within it.

Not as a conqueror.

But as its newest prisoner.

The birth of the new cycle did not go unnoticed.
The birth of the new cycle did not go unnoticed.

Overlord Velmora took interest in the anomaly. A new Light Lord had emerged far too quickly—when, by all laws of the cycle, it should have been the Dark Lord who fell. Curious to see what had disrupted the balance, Velmora came to witness it herself.

She expected to find what she had seen countless times before: a broken, hollow Dark Lord, stripped of will and identity.

Instead, she found Vorakhel.

He was thinking. Questioning. Defiant.

That unsettled her more than any wound.

When Vorakhel spoke of his ambitions—of ending the war, of breaking the cycle itself—Velmora laughed.

Not cruelly.

Amused.

He may have bent the cycle sooner than expected, she admitted. But he had not broken it. The war still endured. Balance still demanded blood. With that final truth, Velmora vanished, leaving Vorakhel alone with doubt gnawing at his resolve.

But Vorakhel refused to accept her judgment.

Determined to prove her wrong, he marched to confront the newly born Light Lord.

What he found shocked him.

The Light Lord wore the armor of a Blue Knight—an order Vorakhel knew he had exterminated long ago during his service under the Ancient Red Demon. And yet this knight stood before him, reborn by the cycle itself.

Still, Vorakhel did not draw his blade.

Instead, he spoke.

He told the Light Lord the truth—that their war served no purpose. That neither Light nor Dark would ever truly win, only be replaced. That conquest was meaningless when the world reset itself with every victory.

There was another way.

They would no longer seek each other’s destruction. Instead, they would wage war through proxies—minions against minions, conflicts contained and limited. Balance would be preserved without endless annihilation.

After a long silence, the Light Lord agreed.

The war did not end.

But for the first time in its history, it was restrained.

Vorakhel believed his actions would go unnoticed.

He was wrong.

After the pact with the new Light Lord was sealed, Velmora returned. This time, there was no mockery in her expression. She admitted that she had misjudged him.

She told Vorakhel that she had witnessed countless Dark Lords and Light Lords rise and fall across ages uncounted. Every time, the cycle corrected itself. Each Dark Lord was shaped to be the perfect counter to the Light Lord of their era—and each Light Lord, in turn, was forged to oppose its Dark.

The truth explained everything.

It was why the new Light Lord had taken the form of a Blue Knight—a reflection of Vorakhel’s own past, crafted by the cycle itself to stand against him.

Then Velmora spoke the words that truly shook him.

She could free him from the cycle.

But there was a price.

Vorakhel would need to survive the next fifty thousand years.

Confused, Vorakhel objected. He believed he had already ended the war—halted the cycle through restraint and compromise.

Velmora laughed, genuinely amused.

She explained that the cycle was not a war at all.

It was a self-correcting system.

She knew who had created it. Though those beings were long gone—and their absence was the very reason she now stood in their place—the mechanism they left behind still functioned perfectly.

If the cycle detected imbalance, it would repair itself.

It would create new beings capable of killing the Lords.
Or it would force one Lord to destroy the other.
Or it would twist fate itself until blood was spilled once more.

Vorakhel demanded to know why she could not end it now.

Velmora answered calmly.

She did not need his help yet.

Before leaving, she reassured him—almost gently—that although she was ancient beyond measure, she would remember him.

And she would return.

In fifty thousand years.
Velmora grew tired of the meaningless struggle.

At last, she activated her Art Effect.

Color flooded back into it.

From its core erupted a pink beam of gravity—dense, absolute. When it struck Vorakhel, it felt as though entire mountains collapsed upon him at once. Bone, will, and magic were crushed beneath impossible pressure. His knees buckled. His weapons fell from his hands.

There was no resistance.

There was only surrender.

Vorakhel admitted defeat.

He swore to continue serving Velmora and to obey her will—but on one condition.

He would not kill his son.

Velmora considered this.

Then she accepted.

She did not demand his death. Instead, she ordered him to prepare for what was to come. Velmora made it appear as though Vorakhel had been slain—erased by her hand, his existence reduced to rumor and myth. History recorded his fall. The cycle remained intact.

But Vorakhel lived.

Stripped of title.
Stripped of freedom.
Bound now to a will older than the cycle itself.

Waiting.

For thousands of years, Velmora trained him personally.

She tore apart every weakness in his spellcraft. She broke his instincts, corrected his habits, and taught him control where once there had only been force. Under her guidance, Vorakhel’s power evolved—no longer crude domination, but precise, refined destruction.

Then the day came when Velmora required his aid.

She brought Vorakhel to a vast graveyard of witches, stretching beyond the horizon—tombs of queens, covens, and legends long forgotten. The air itself was heavy with lingering magic.

There, Velmora revealed her true intention.

Vorakhel believed she had gone mad.
There was nothing he could do to stop her.

So he did the only thing he could.

He helped.

Both of them poured their power into the spell. Magic on that scale warped the land beneath their feet, twisting the air until even time felt uncertain. As Velmora focused, Vorakhel felt something dangerous stir within himself.

For a brief moment, revenge crossed his mind.

Velmora faltered.

Blood ran from her as she rose unsteadily, her gaze sharp despite the wound. She warned him—calmly, coldly—that she was still capable of fighting. If he moved against her now, it would be his end.

The spell was complete.

And yet… nothing happened.

Silence followed.

Then doubt.

A minute later, reality split open.

A vast golden ring formed above them—radiant, ancient, and unmistakably foreign. Velmora stared upward in shock.

This was not her spell.

Yet it worked.

And it was far more powerful than she had intended.

Velmora laughed softly. She thanked Vorakhel, telling him that once her mana fully returned, she would free him as promised. Until then, he still had a role to play.

She ordered him to return.

With a gesture, she sent him away.

Vorakhel reappeared in his castle.

Sevrin Null stood waiting.

Without hesitation, Sevrin returned the title of Dark Lord to his father and stepped aside, choosing to pursue his own path. For the first time in ages, Vorakhel reclaimed what had once been his.

But the moment the throne accepted him, he felt it.

Something was wrong.

Velmora’s spell had worked too well.

From beyond time and memory, past Dark Lords—long dead, long erased—began to stir. Their wills clawed at reality, drawn toward a throne that should never have been reclaimed.

They were coming.

Not to serve.

But to take it from him.
Fighting each Dark Lord was brutal.

Through blood and ruin, Vorakhel uncovered the truth behind the throne itself. The Chair of the Dark Lord was not merely a symbol of rule—it was a reservoir of immense, ancient magic. Whoever truly claimed it could draw upon that power.

But the throne demanded a price.

Its full strength would not answer while challengers remained. As long as others contested the title, its power stayed locked—fractured, divided among those who sought it.

To claim it completely, Vorakhel had only one path.

He had to defeat every Dark Lord who dared reach for the throne.

One by one, they came.

Each battle pushed him to the brink—different powers, different eras, different incarnations of darkness itself. Yet Velmora’s training proved its worth. Vorakhel endured. He adapted. He learned.

And every time, he emerged victorious.

Not all were destroyed.

Nearly every Dark Lord he defeated chose to kneel rather than fall. They pledged themselves to him, recognizing not only his strength, but his understanding of the cycle that had imprisoned them all.

Thus, Vorakhel became something unprecedented.

Not merely a Dark Lord.

But the Overlord of the Dark Lords.

When the final challenger fell and the throne’s power at last settled, Velmora returned. True to her word, she severed Vorakhel’s chains—the bindings of the cycle, the debt he owed her.

Then she did something no Overlord had ever done before.

She welcomed him into the Overlord Alliance.

No longer a pawn.
No longer a prisoner of cycles.

But a power acknowledged by those who shaped reality itself.

Vorakhel had begun as a stone demon who refused to be a tool.

He ended as an Overlord—ruler of the darkness that once enslaved him.
