# Queen Crule

**Age:** Unknown  
**Size:** 1.68 
**Magic:** creation, purple fames, later red demon magic 
**Source of Magic:** Vaelthryx’s later on acint red demon
Ever since Vaelthryx entered Cruel, she has been able to summon pink spears, unleash bursts of pink energy from her lance, create shields, open portals, and greatly increase her strength and speed. Later, after consuming the Red Demon, she retained the same magic—but it became far more powerful. She also gained increased defense and much faster regeneration.

# Lore

Queen Cruel is the only human Overlord in the region.

She was born into the Ashen Vow Clan, an ancient human lineage of elite demon slayers sworn to hunt creatures of the night. From the moment she could walk, Cruel was surrounded by steel, wards, and stories of monsters that wore crowns.

When Cruel was only six years old, the Ashen Vow Clan was attacked by the Vampire Demon King, Vaelthryx the Crimson Sovereign—a being feared even among demon royalty.
The clan fought with everything they had. Their warriors annihilated Vaelthryx’s army, turning the battlefield into a graveyard of ash and blood, but against the Demon King himself, they stood no chance.

Knowing the end was near, Cruel’s parents pressed a forbidden magical knife into her hands—an artifact designed to wound beings far beyond human limits. They told her to hide and survive.

The clan put up a desperate final stand. Steel clashed with nightmare. Magic burned the sky.
In the end, Vaelthryx stood victorious.

Hunger overtook him. He began searching for survivors—and that was when he sensed Cruel.

When he found her, alone and shaking, he did not hesitate. He lunged forward, tongue extended, intending to devour her soul and feast on her terror.

That was his greatest mistake.

His tongue struck the knife before it reached her.

In that instant, Vaelthryx vanished.

Unknown to Cruel, the blade did not kill him—it bound him. The Demon King was torn from the physical world and sealed inside her mind. His power, his presence, and his aura were forcibly transferred into her.

A child survived what no human ever should have.

For the next four years, Cruel lived alone in the wilds. She hunted, hid, and endured, never fully understanding how she remained alive—or why no beast ever dared approach her.

She did not know that the aura of a Demon King radiated from her, bending instinct itself into fear.

Eventually, she set out in search of human civilization.

During her travels, one man alone dared to confront her: Kael Rendor, a legendary human spear master who hunted evil by instinct rather than sight. He sensed something monstrous within her and prepared to strike.

But when he truly looked at her, he saw not a demon—
only a lonely child carrying an impossible burden.

Unable to kill her, Kael took her into his home and raised her as his own.

He taught her how to wield a spear, how to survive among humans, and—most importantly—how to suppress her terrifying aura. As Cruel’s training continued, a terrifying truth revealed itself.

The more she used her magic, the more Vaelthryx began to awaken.

At first it was whispers—echoes at the edge of her thoughts. Then came dreams soaked in blood, visions of fangs and crowns, and a presence that pressed against her mind like a locked door slowly being forced open.

Her master understood the danger immediately.

Kael Rendor forbade her from using her magic unless her life truly depended on it.
Every spell was a risk. Every surge of power fed the Demon King sleeping within her.

To protect her—and to keep her under watch—Kael brought Cruel to the Kingdom of Elarion, placing her directly beneath the crown’s authority.

The king of Elarion was wary. A child surrounded by fear, carrying an aura that felt wrong, was not something a ruler ignored lightly. Yet Kael was the kingdom’s greatest spear master, a man whose loyalty had never once been questioned.

Reluctantly, the king allowed Cruel to stay.

Years passed.

Cruel trained relentlessly, favoring discipline and steel over magic. She joined the Royal Guard as soon as she was old enough, hiding her true nature behind control, precision, and silence. While others relied on brute strength or spells, she fought with flawless technique and terrifying efficiency.

She rose through the ranks at an unnatural pace.

Soldiers whispered that she never hesitated.
Commanders noticed that battles ended faster when she was present.
Enemies felt dread long before she ever lifted her spear.

Yet Cruel never used her magic unless forced.

Because each time she did, Vaelthryx stirred.

And deep within her mind, the Crimson Sovereign waited—
patient, amused, and growing stronger with every drop of power she drew upon.

patient, amused, and growing stronger with every drop of power she drew upon. Then Kael Rendor died.

With his death, the last shield between Cruel and the crown vanished.

The king wasted no time.

Under the guise of honor, Cruel was given a death mission—an order no human was meant to survive. She was commanded to slay a Death Dragon, an ancient creature whose breath erased life itself.

Cruel accepted without protest.

As she traveled, an unease clawed at her chest. The farther she went, the louder Vaelthryx’s presence became—restless, alert. When she finally faced the dragon, the battle was brutal. Steel alone was not enough.

And then she felt it.

The kingdom was under attack.

Fear, blood, screaming—she sensed it through the Demon King’s aura.

With no other choice, Cruel unleashed her magic.

Dark power surged through her veins. The Death Dragon fell, its corpse collapsing into lifeless ash. Vaelthryx laughed inside her mind as she turned and ran—faster than any human should be able to—back toward the capital.

When she arrived, the city was burning.

Vampires flooded the streets.

Cruel did not hesitate.

She fought through them like a storm, saving soldiers, civilians, and children alike. Every strike reeked of terror. Every enemy felt the weight of a Demon King bearing down upon them.

And in doing so—

She exposed her true aura.

The surviving vampires fled.

The people she saved fell silent.

The king looked upon her not as a protector—but as a threat greater than the enemy.

Terrified, he ordered her captured.

Cruel did not resist.
She did not fight back.
She did not even argue.

She was bound in chains and thrown into the depths of the dungeon as the city mourned and whispered.

That night, a visitor came.

A God of Knowledge, veiled in runes and starlight, stepped into her cell. He was amused. Impressed. Curious.

He told her the truth: she had surpassed what mortals were meant to be.

And he offered to help her.

With a gesture, he teleported Cruel outside the city—just as a second vampire assault began.

Cruel tried to rush back.

But the god stopped her.

He stalled.

He watched.

He waited for one thing only—

The king’s death.

Only when the crown fell did the god finally step aside and allow Cruel to return, releasing her back into the chaos to save the people once more.

And in that moment, the fate of the kingdom was sealed.

Only when the crown fell did the god finally step aside and allow Cruel to return, releasing her back into the chaos to save the people once more.

And in that moment, the fate of the kingdom was sealed.

Cruel rushed back into the ruined city, fighting for whoever was still alive.

With the aid of the God of Knowledge, the second vampire assault was annihilated. The streets fell silent once more—this time not from fear, but from exhaustion and awe.

When the battle ended, Cruel turned to the god and demanded an answer.

Why had he not let her help the moment the attack began?

The God of Knowledge spoke calmly.

Had she appeared immediately, the people would have believed she had fled imprisonment, abandoning the kingdom in its darkest hour. She would have been branded a traitor—another monster wearing a human face.

He had waited so that when she returned, she would be seen not as an escapee…

…but as a savior.

And because the king had died during the attack, there was no throne left to deny her.

The kingdom now belonged to Queen Cruel.

Before departing, the God of Knowledge stayed with her for years, teaching her what no mortal should ever know. He showed her how to refine her magic without awakening Vaelthryx, how to seal the Demon King permanently within her mind, and how to deny him any path to dominance.

He taught her vengeance.

Cruel learned to craft a soul-draining shield that devoured the energy of her enemies with every strike. She mastered the lance, a weapon capable of channeling her power safely and precisely—turning her into a living engine of war.

When her training was complete, the god made her an offer.

She could remain and rule.

Or she could save humanity.

Cruel chose the harder path.

She left her kingdom behind, entrusting it to the God of Knowledge, who swore to protect it in her absence. Then she marched across the world—through frozen wastelands, cursed forests, shattered realms, and even into Hell itself—freeing human tribes from demons, monsters, and tyrants.

Those who witnessed her power bent the knee willingly.

Not out of love.

But out of awe and fear.

Kingdom by kingdom, humanity united under her banner.

Queen Cruel ruled the largest human empire seen in thousands of years.

She became the most feared human ever to live in the region—an existence so terrifying that even monsters hesitated to speak her name.

She lived for twenty thousand years, defying mortality through sheer will, knowledge, and power.

The other Overlords respected her.

Some feared her.

One tested her.

She survived a battle against Father Crow himself—wounded, broken, but alive. A feat no other human could ever claim.

Yet Cruel was still human.

And humans do not live forever.

When Queen Cruel finally died, the world felt it. Without her presence, her vast empire fractured. Borders shrank. Old enemies returned. The kingdom she built weakened, no longer held together by her will alone.

But her legacy endured.

She was not a god.
She was not a demon.

She was worse.

She was Queen Cruel—
The human who ruled monsters, defied death, and terrified eternity itself.

But even in death, Queen Cruel’s story did not end.

When the Revival occurred, Cruel opened her eyes to a shattered throne room and a fractured kingdom. Time had passed. Empires had shifted. Faith had eroded.

Only her most loyal knights remained—warriors who had refused to kneel to any other ruler, guarding her resting place for centuries.

And one more presence endured.

The God of Knowledge still waited.

He revealed all that had transpired since her death: the fragmentation of her empire, the rise of new powers, and the frailty of humanity without her shadow looming over the world. Then he spoke of the final truth.

If Cruel wished to grow stronger—stronger than she had ever been in life—she would need to consume the Ancient Red Demon Flesh, a relic of a primordial demon whose remains still burned with world-ending power.

There was a cost.

The knowledge he shared was the last thing he had left to give.

As the truth settled into her mind, the God of Knowledge perished—his purpose fulfilled, his existence spent entirely on shaping her future.

Cruel mourned him in silence.

She understood immediately that the forces still loyal to her were not enough to challenge the Red Demon. So she made a choice born not of pride, but of wisdom.

She led her people to a hidden sanctuary, heavily warded and protected, then departed alone—not as a queen seeking subjects, but as a conqueror seeking allies.

This time, species did not matter.

Human or monster—strength was strength.

During her travels, Cruel encountered three legendary warlords, each ruling through fear and conquest:

Lord Sheng,
Lord Anomyr,
and Lord Kael’Thyrr.

Cruel did not beg.

She subdued them.

Through combat, strategy, and sheer presence, she forced all three to kneel. Their combined armies more than doubled her own, forging a force unseen since her first reign.

With this new power, Queen Cruel reclaimed her territory, annihilating rivals and retaking strongholds long thought lost. Soon after, she rejoined the Overlords’ Alliance—not as a relic of the past, but as a revived force of dominance.

Her return did not go unnoticed.

Her actions drew the gaze of a new deity:
Vathryssa, the Witch Goddess of War.

Vathryssa had no intention of aiding Cruel. She simply found her entertaining.

A human who defied death.
A ruler who commanded monsters.
A queen who treated gods as negotiable obstacles.

Vathryssa chose to linger, watching the carnage like a spectator at a grand game.

Cruel did not object.

As long as the goddess did not interfere, she was free to watch.

With her armies unified and her throne reclaimed, Queen Cruel finally turned toward her true goal.

The Ancient Red Demon awaited.

And with its flesh, Cruel would ascend once more—
not as a queen reborn…

…but as something far more dangerous.

The Ancient Red Demon awaited.

And with its flesh, Cruel would ascend once more—
not as a queen reborn…

…but as something far more dangerous.

Defeating the Ancient Red Demon proved far more difficult than Queen Cruel had anticipated.

Its power was primordial. Every wound regenerated in flame. Every roar cracked reality itself. Cruel pushed herself beyond her limits, her magic straining against the seals that bound Vaelthryx. For the first time since her revival, defeat felt possible.

Then the battlefield shifted.

An unexpected force descended from the sky.

The Owl Demon King, commander of the Aool Knights, entered the battle alongside his elite order. His motives were neither loyalty nor mercy. He sought the Red Demon’s power for himself, intending to deliver it to King Aool, whom he served as one of his highest-ranking knights.

For a brief, violent moment, Cruel and the Owl Demon King fought side by side.

It was enough.

As the Red Demon turned its attention toward the newly arrived threat, Cruel acted without hesitation. She tore a portion of the Red Demon’s flesh from its body—searing, living, and still burning with ancient power.

Before anyone could react, Cruel teleported herself and her forces away, abandoning the battlefield entirely.

She left the Owl Demon King and the Aool Knights alone to face the enraged Red Demon.

The move was calculated.

Cruel had never promised honor—only victory.

The aftermath was catastrophic.

King Aool was furious.

Seeing Cruel’s actions as both theft and betrayal, he ordered the Aool Knights to hunt her down and reclaim the stolen flesh. The Owl Demon King led the pursuit personally, bound by duty and humiliation.

But Cruel was no longer alone.

Her return to the Overlords’ Alliance bore fruit.

Other Overlords intervened—blocking paths, shattering pursuit lines, and making it unmistakably clear that striking Queen Cruel meant war with them all. Faced with overwhelming opposition, the Aool Knights were forced to retreat.

The message was undeniable.

Queen Cruel had stolen power from a primordial demon, humiliated one of King Aool’s highest knights, and survived the consequences.

Once again, the region was reminded of a simple truth:

Cruel did not rule through loyalty.
She ruled through fear, timing, and ruthless intelligence.

And with the Red Demon’s flesh now in her possession, her transformation had only just begun.

Once again, the region was reminded of a simple truth:

Cruel did not rule through loyalty.
She ruled through fear, timing, and ruthless intelligence.

And with the Red Demon’s flesh now in her possession, her transformation had only just begun.

After consuming the flesh of the Ancient Red Demon, Cruel nearly lost herself.

The power was violent and invasive—an alien will clawing through her mind, attempting to overwrite her existence. The Red Demon raged within her, seeking dominance, seeking rebirth.

For the first time in centuries, Cruel faltered.

But she was no longer alone within her mind.

Vaelthryx rose to meet the threat.

Demon King against Demon King—one bound by chains of will, the other newly devoured and feral. Cruel fought alongside Vaelthryx, not as a vessel, but as a ruler. Together, they crushed the Red Demon’s consciousness, sealing it beneath layers of control and dominance.

Cruel did not merely survive the fusion.

She mastered it.

With her mind stabilized and her power fully under her command, Queen Cruel entered the Overlord Tournament—a battlefield where gods, demons, and nightmares tested their right to rule.

She rose through the ranks relentlessly.

Overlord after Overlord fell.

By the time she reached the finals, the impossible had occurred.

A human stood at the peak.

Her opponent was Father Crow.

From the moment the battle began, Cruel understood she was outmatched. His movements were precise, merciless, effortless. Blow after blow shattered her defenses, forcing her back.

Then she unleashed her new power.

She struck with speed and force beyond anything she had revealed before, catching Father Crow off guard—or so she believed. She knocked him back, drew blood, and for a single heartbeat, she thought the tide had turned.

Then Father Crow stopped himself mid-slide.

Calmly, he reached behind him.

And drew his halberd.

In that moment, Cruel understood the truth.

He had been holding back.

The fight ended swiftly after that.

Cruel lost.

But she was not humiliated.

Father Crow extended his hand and helped her to her feet. He congratulated her sincerely, admitting that he had never believed a human could reach the finals of the Overlord Tournament.

Where others would have seen defeat, Cruel saw opportunity.

She had survived him.

She had impressed him.

And perhaps… she could learn from him.

When the tournament rankings were finalized, Cruel was placed at Rank 10 among the Overlords—a position no human had ever achieved.

In the years that followed, her kingdom entered the safest era in its history.

Her membership in the Overlords’ Alliance drastically reduced external threats. Her power alone discouraged rebellion. And her association with Father Crow ensured that even the boldest enemies reconsidered before acting.

Queen Cruel had become something unprecedented.

Not the strongest.
Not the most ruthless.

But the most untouchable human to ever exist.

And her story was far from over.
