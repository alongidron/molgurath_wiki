Ever since Vaelthryx entered Cruel, she has been able to summon pink spears, unleash bursts of pink energy from her lance, create shields, open portals, and greatly increase her strength and speed. Later, after consuming the Red Demon, she retained the same magic—but it became far more powerful. She also gained increased defense and much faster regeneration.

# Lore

Queen Cruel is the only human Overlord in the region.

She was born into the Ashen Vow Clan, an ancient human lineage of elite demon slayers sworn to hunt creatures of the night. From the moment she could walk, Cruel was surrounded by steel, wards, and stories of monsters that wore crowns.

When Cruel was only six years old, the Ashen Vow Clan was attacked by the Vampire Demon King, Vaelthryx the Crimson Sovereign—a being feared even among demon royalty.
The clan fought with everything they had. Their warriors annihilated Vaelthryx’s army, turning the battlefield into a graveyard of ash and blood, but against the Demon King himself, they stood no chance.

Knowing the end was near, Cruel’s parents pressed a forbidden magical knife into her hands—an artifact designed to wound beings far beyond human limits. They told her to hide and survive.

The clan put up a desperate final stand. Steel clashed with nightmare. Magic burned the sky.
In the end, Vaelthryx stood victorious.

Hunger overtook him. He began searching for survivors—and that was when he sensed Cruel.

When he found her, alone and shaking, he did not hesitate. He lunged forward, tongue extended, intending to devour her soul and feast on her terror.

That was his greatest mistake.

His tongue struck the knife before it reached her.

In that instant, Vaelthryx vanished.

Unknown to Cruel, the blade did not kill him—it bound him. The Demon King was torn from the physical world and sealed inside her mind. His power, his presence, and his aura were forcibly transferred into her.

A child survived what no human ever should have.

For the next four years, Cruel lived alone in the wilds. She hunted, hid, and endured, never fully understanding how she remained alive—or why no beast ever dared approach her.

She did not know that the aura of a Demon King radiated from her, bending instinct itself into fear.

Eventually, she set out in search of human civilization.

During her travels, one man alone dared to confront her: Kael Rendor, a legendary human spear master who hunted evil by instinct rather than sight. He sensed something monstrous within her and prepared to strike.

But when he truly looked at her, he saw not a demon—
only a lonely child carrying an impossible burden.

Unable to kill her, Kael took her into his home and raised her as his own.

He taught her how to wield a spear, how to survive among humans, and—most importantly—how to suppress her terrifying aura. As Cruel’s training continued, a terrifying truth revealed itself.

The more she used her magic, the more Vaelthryx began to awaken.

At first it was whispers—echoes at the edge of her thoughts. Then came dreams soaked in blood, visions of fangs and crowns, and a presence that pressed against her mind like a locked door slowly being forced open.

Her master understood the danger immediately.

Kael Rendor forbade her from using her magic unless her life truly depended on it.
Every spell was a risk. Every surge of power fed the Demon King sleeping within her.

To protect her—and to keep her under watch—Kael brought Cruel to the Kingdom of Elarion, placing her directly beneath the crown’s authority.

The king of Elarion was wary. A child surrounded by fear, carrying an aura that felt wrong, was not something a ruler ignored lightly. Yet Kael was the kingdom’s greatest spear master, a man whose loyalty had never once been questioned.

Reluctantly, the king allowed Cruel to stay.

Years passed.

Cruel trained relentlessly, favoring discipline and steel over magic. She joined the Royal Guard as soon as she was old enough, hiding her true nature behind control, precision, and silence. While others relied on brute strength or spells, she fought with flawless technique and terrifying efficiency.

She rose through the ranks at an unnatural pace.

Soldiers whispered that she never hesitated.
Commanders noticed that battles ended faster when she was present.
Enemies felt dread long before she ever lifted her spear.

Yet Cruel never used her magic unless forced.

Because each time she did, Vaelthryx stirred.

And deep within her mind, the Crimson Sovereign waited—
patient, amused, and growing stronger with every drop of power she drew upon.
