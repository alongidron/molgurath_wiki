# Humans

Humans have always struggled to survive in a world filled with powerful creatures, especially since most of them lack magic. In the early ages, when God still walked among mortals, He chose to bless humanity, shielding them from the dangers around them. With His protection, humans lived in relative peace and maintained good relations with witches, who often aided them.

However, about two thousand years after the Age of Chaos, a terrible discovery was made: a creature realized that human souls were far more valuable than those of other beings. This revelation led to a great massacre of humanity. Entire populations were wiped out, leaving only a handful of survivors.

Those who endured the slaughter now carry the heavy burden of their fallen kin. They are dedicated to rebuilding what was lost and work tirelessly to bring back the human race, keeping the memory of their people alive against impossible odds.
