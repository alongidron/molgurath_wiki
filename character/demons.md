# Demons

All demons in Hell possess the potential to wield dark magic and to assume a beast form. However, not every demon has the ability—or the strength—to access these powers. Some never awaken their dark magic, while others cannot withstand the transformation into their beast form.

Despite these limitations, demons define themselves through a rigid hierarchy, ranking their kind from the greatest to the lowest. At the top stand the Demon Gods, unmatched in power and influence, while at the very bottom are the Ashlings—the weakest of demonkind, often treated as little more than fodder or servants.
