# warlords

Creatures that command armies—some vast, some small, and some with none at all—yet all share the same desire: to kill. They exist only to slaughter, conquer, and destroy everything in their path. Most will never stop until they are dead, but a rare few manage to restrain themselves. If you encounter a warlord, the battle will always end in death—regardless of whether they are more aggressive or not.
