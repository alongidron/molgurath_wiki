# Hell: The Nine Layers

Hell is the dominion of demons, darkness, and the Devil—structured into nine distinct layers. Each serves a purpose in the machinery of torment, order, and power.

## Layer 1 — The Human Layer
Human souls are confined here, separated from demons and other creatures to preserve their **endless torment**. Because human souls are the most valuable, demons covet them above all else.

## Layer 2 — The Arena
A killing ground where humans and weak creatures battle to the death.  
**Outcomes**:  
- **Creatures**: destroyed or sent to Layer 3.  
- **Humans**: destroyed, sent to Layer 3 or 4, or conscripted to torment souls in Layer 1.

## Layer 3 — The Domain of Creatures
The **largest** layer, vast enough to brush against every Hell in the multiverse. Most demons dwell here; the Devil’s castles and **Hell’s heart** are found within.  
At the center stands a **heavily guarded portal**—watched by a Demon God—that allows travel across all layers (and, for the few permitted, to far places beyond).

## Layer 4 — The Smallest Layer
Tiny but **rich in resources**. A largely peaceful realm of water and wilderness where **nature and water demons** are born before they’re sent to Layer 3. Ruled by **seven Demon Kings** and harboring a **secret portal to Heaven**. Humans assigned here serve the kings.

## Layer 5 — The Cursed Arsenal
Also called **Asmodeus’s Trash Heap**. Discarded and Veylorin weapons accumulate and **absorb blood and dark magic**, becoming cursed. When ~**500** are fully awakened, **demonic spiders** gather and **disperse** them across Layer 3, igniting wars among demons. This cycle recurs about every **500,000 years**, unless Asmodeus intervenes.

## Layer 6 — The Prison
An entire layer given over to the **eternal imprisonment of the Flesh Demon King**.

## Layer 7 — The Threshold of Death
The **entrance to the Death Realms**. Few who cross its gates ever return.

## Layer 8 — The Abyss Realm
A void of **shadow and silence**—a place even demons avoid.

## Layer 9 — The Chaos Seal
The deepest layer: the **prison of the Chaos God**, bound in shackles that predate memory.
