# Supreme Deities 
The Supreme Deities are the most powerful creatures in molgurath. molgurath created some of them to entertain himself because he is just a planet and enjoys watching the creatures living on him and some got trop by him.   
some of The Supreme Deities have the most important roles, so molgurath made sure they would be unkillable. If they somehow die, there will be a major catastrophe in the world.
