# Overlords of the Land Between

**Overlords** are the rulers of the land between Heaven and Hell, beings so powerful that they can defend their kingdoms even against the gods themselves.  

To earn the title of Overlord, one must meet three unshakable requirements:  

1. **Unmatched Power** – An Overlord must be so strong that even if a god were to challenge them, they could stand their ground and strike back.  
2. **A Claimed Domain** – Every Overlord must hold a territory, whether it is a mighty castle, a fortress hidden in the mountains, or a small but undeniable mark of dominion. Size does not matter, but the land must be claimed and defended.  
3. **Fearless Resolve** – An Overlord never flees from a challenge. Even when defeat is certain, they face their enemies without hesitation.  

Overlords are the embodiment of dominance, courage, and defiance, ruling the twilight realm between divine and infernal powers.

## Overlords of Grymmwald

In the region of **Grymmwald**, the path to becoming an Overlord carries an additional requirement: **acceptance of the Overlords’ Agreement**, known as **The Treaty**. This treaty governs the political balance of power and ensures survival in a land overshadowed by the **Guardian** and its dungeon.  

### Key Points of the Treaty

#### 1. Redistribution of Territories
- Overlords relinquish lands adjacent to the **neutral zone**, surrounding the Guardian’s dungeon.  
- Each Lord receives **expanded territory elsewhere**, ensuring no overall loss of power.  
- The neutral zone acts as a **protective buffer**, minimizing outside interference.  
- **Lordless creatures and lesser beings** are left free to thrive, encouraging natural and magical evolution.  

#### 2. Non-Aggression Pact
- Overlords are **forbidden from attacking each other**.  
- Mutual assistance is **not required**, but internal wars are forbidden to preserve collective strength.  

#### 3. Regular Summits
- Periodic **Overlord Summits** maintain diplomacy and resolve disputes without bloodshed.  
- Summits discuss **security, resources, and the state of each realm**, keeping all Lords accountable.

The **Overlords’ Agreement** reshaped Grymmwald into a realm of calculated tension and cautious peace, where each Lord holds their ground under the shadow of the Guardian. Breaking the treaty risks war with all Overlords combined.
